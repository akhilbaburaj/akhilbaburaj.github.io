        <title>Beyond Faces</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“It’s Seven P.M. Time I wrapped my work and head home”, said Amaya as she sorted out the papers on her desk and stacked them in their file. She looks around and finds no one in office. Pretty usual sight as people usually leave by four or five in the evening. It is not that Amaya is bad at her work, it’s that people tend to rely on her a lot when they can’t get something done on time. Truth be told, it is more of people taking advantage of her. Amaya works hard and really does her job good but, she is not the type to stand out. An average girl to look at and talk to as well. There isn’t anything ‘fun’ she would bring to the table. She does gardening however, I don’t think that is what people wanted to hear. She walked to the elevator, and headed out of office. While taking the metro to reach home she over heard a couple girls talking to each other. They were talking about a new Dating App and how great it is. Amaya did not have boyfriend and she knows that it’s her fault for not trying her best. She wore little to no make-up, she wore plain clothes and her enthusiasm level in a group was fairly low. “It would be nice to know on how to engage in a conversation with people”, she thought. She lied on her bed and she installed the App on her phone, but after pausing for a few minutes she refrained from creating an account. “This is silly. Don’t fall to such level now Amaya.”, she said to herself. She kept the phone on the side stand and went to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next day in office during her break to the pantry she bumped into a group of her team members. They were all talking about their recent dinner dates. She tried to dodge the conversion and moved up closer to the coffee machine. “Hey! Amaya, what about you? How is your boyfriend?”, asked a colleague. “Umm.. I don’t have one right now”, Amaya replied. “Oh? How about your previous..”, the others abruptly stopped him from asking further. There was an awkward silence around the pantry room and she headed back to her desk in embarrassment. That night Amaya decided to create her account however, when it came to the point of putting the name and picture she started to hesitate. She decided to go through it and created her profile. However, this was not a regular profile. She kept her name as Bellossom after the Pokemon she adored and used the cartoon picture as a profile. Here exceptions weren’t much but she figured someone might have a similar liking. She was taken to a section called ‘people near by’ and while she scrolled through the list she was hit up with a direct message. “Hi”, it read. She was anxious as this was the first time she is interacting to a complete stranger. Before she could respond she got the next message. “I’m in town for the week. Want to hook up?”. She fell shallow for the kind of message she got. She immediately blocked him off. Few minutes pass by and she gets another one, then another. It looks like all she attracted were creeps. She felt depressed seeing how the only these kind of people reached out to her. She was about to remove the App and forget this experiment when, she found one profile, Quasimodo. This was a cartoon character she know about from Disney’s The Hunchback of Notre Dame movie. She had a small smile on my face when she saw there was profile as similar as hers. She sent out a message, “Hi. Didn’t Quasimodo already have Esmeralda? Didn’t know Quasimodo was so bold to double date.”, hoping it would be a good start. Few minutes past by, but no reply. ‘Guess the account is not used anymore, she thought. She kept her phone on the night stand and went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wakes up the next day and finds a response in the App while she doing morning ordeal. “Hahahaha! I didn’t know Pokemon were on the App either. But I guess you are referring to the Quasimodo from Disney’s movie. The true story is much darker though. If you don’t mind having your world turned upside down then, I will recommend you try Victor Hugo’s novel. It is a pretty good read.” Curiosity got the better of Amaya and she did a quick search online and found that it indeed was true. On route to work she stopped by the local library and picked up the copy. She read the novel and was immediately hooked on to it. She kept reading even at work and was nearly done by end of the day. What he said was indeed true, the story would flip anyone’s world if they thought the movie was genuine. Let alone Disney’s version. “I actually looked up what you said and borrowed the book. Wow, it’s such a dark and tragic story. Much different than what the movie had shown.”, Amaya replied. “Glad you liked it. Not all movies capture the true story as it written.”, came the response. “Indeed. So Quasimodo, are you looking for your Esmeralda here?”, texted Amaya. “Hahaha. May be yes, may be not. Just trying something out. How about you? Didn’t expect a Pokemon to be on an Dating App. Are all the other pokemon’s caught by the trainers.”. Amaya chuckled at his response. It wasn’t a great joke but someone was playing along rather than be blunt about their intension to get into ones pants. Amaya continued texting him all night. A casual, silly talk where both just wanted to have a decent conversation without a goal. They ended their conversation for the night and bid to catch up again tomorrow. She hit her bed with a smile on her face and cozzed her under her blanket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the weeks passed by she texted him a lot more frequently. She works just like she always did however, during her breaks she used to text and so would he. Neither of them have told who they really are and kept their identity confined however, both enjoyed the other’s company. Even if it was just messages over a phone. He was an avid reader and a cook. He has read a ton of books and owns quite a collections. He would recommend novels and Amaya would give it a try. Amaya too let her passion for gardening be know. He was encouraging and stirred up the conversation to know her likes. They would share picture of what they cooked or what they read or what plants they saw. Both enjoyed what they had and their picture collection grew over the weeks. Lines of texts, shapes of leaves, flowers from plants, food on plates and many more. Amaya was seen to be more happy at work and people could see this. Occasionally colleagues would ask what was going on but the idea of sharing to them held her back. She felt bad that she was still not much different on the outside. That night while she talked with him things went a bit awkward for her. “Hey, if it is ok with you, Would you like to grab a cup of coffee at a book cafe located near River St.?” was the text she had got. Amaya was nervous. She didn’t want to ruin how things are between then however, she did not feel confident about herself to meet him yet. She didn’t want to say ‘Yes’ yet but she didn’t have a right reason to tell him ‘No’ either. “I think I will pass. It is not that I don’t want to meet you but I am not comfortable yet to meet you in person. I really hope you would understand.”, she wrote her words down but hesitated to hit send. She took awhile bouncing her mind and heart around and after few minutes, after taking a deep breathe, she hit send. “…”, she saw him type his response and she anxiously waiting for the words to pop-up. She was completely glued to her screen. “Ok. I understand. May be another time I guess. If you do know of a place you want to meet sometime later, I’m, ok with that too.” , his response made her so happy but she felt bad for missing out a chance in known him better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few days later during their usual nightly conversations Amaya was brought with one the most oddest ideas she has heard in her life. “Hey, what are your plans for this weekend?”, he asked. “Nothing much. Probably read one of the books you mentioned few days back, why?”, she replied. “Well, I was thinking if we could meet this weekend.”, he said. Amaya felt uncomfortable to say No, however she still felt she was not ready yet. “I know you said you were not comfortable and I guess it is still the same. But I would like to try something out. It is new and probably that I myself would not have done one on my own but I guess it will work out for both of us”, he stated. Amaya felt happy to know he still is considerate about her but she was curious to know what he had planned out. “What do you have in mind?”, she asked. “So, there is a comic-con this weekend at the sports dome. Just to give you an idea, you can dress up as anyone you want and attend it. If you are up for it, we could meet up but all costumed up. I know it sounds silly but, would you want to try it out?”. Amaya was confused with idea but as hysterical and embarrassing as it sounds she felt it could work. “Are you sure? I would feel really embarrassed to go to such a place all dressed up?”, she added. “I know but, the fun part is that we are allowed to be dressed up. So we probably are not gonna stand out much.”, he said. After taking few minutes and running the idea down her head she decided to say ‘Yes’. She knew she could say ‘No’ however, she didn’t want to push him off again. She really did want to know him better and this might be the best chance for her. They both agreed to meet up near the entrance with their costumes. Amaya went to bed wondering how this would go about. She was anxious to meet him and at the same time felt embarrassed about what she is about to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the day of comic-con and there was a lot of people at the dome. Amaya truly was new to the place and she was too embarrassed to be too visible. So she wore very casual clothes and a hoodie. She had a Guy Fawkes mask that she had from last Halloween. She anxiously waited at the entrance, the place where they both decide to meet up. They planned to meet up and then shared the costume details. Few minutes pass by and Amaya was already amused by the shear number of people attending the comic-con and the costume they had. It was a colorful venue with a lot of happy faces around. While she was looking around she gets a text, “I’m here. Wearing a white-shirt and carrying a duffel”. She quickly looks around and spots him. “Found you! I’m walking towards you. I am wearing a hoodie”, she replied. He starts to look around and as she approached from behind, he turned around. Amaya was shocked with his costume. He wore a horse mask wearing glasses. It was the most silliest thing she has seen till date and she burst out in laughter. “Bellossom? Is that you?”, he asked. “Yes!”, she replied laughing. “Good to know you are enjoying what I am wearing. I didn’t know what to wear even through I proposed the idea. So I picked up the first think I could wear. What are you supposed to be?”, he asked. “Honestly, I would call this Annoymous on vacation”, Amaya replied and they both chuckled for a while. “One of my friend’s recently had traveled to Japan. Since you enjoy gardening I though of getting something for you.”, he pulled out a packet of seeds and gave it to her. “It’s supposed to something called as ‘Bonsai Tree’, tree in a pot. Not sure if you would know.”, he said. “Yes, I know. Thank you so much!. I’m so sorry I came empty handed. Where are my manners”, Amaya frantically responded. “That’s fine. I’m kinda intrigued to see how they grow, let me know how they do”, he replied giving a thumbs up as the mask clearly covered his facial expression. After that they went to watch the comic-con exhibition. They both talked a lot about their personal experiences, the music they listened to, the places they have been to, all but their name and what they did for work. They roamed the exhibition and took lot of pictures with each other and with others people with their costumes. A lot of photo-boming and may fun moments. During lunch they both eat with their mask on. Both looked ridiculous when doing so and laugh at each other but, they were fine with it. The day ended and Amaya felt a lot closer to him but there still a fear in her when he asked if she wants both to remove the mask now. That night Amaya realized that next time she will not mess-up and will take the next step. Not because she felt she was ready but because she knew that he would understand her situation as long as she is honest with him and truly was someone to get connected to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Days passed and Amaya’s confidence grew just like the planted tree seeds, they still continued using their fake alias but it had reached a point that it did not matter much. They both grew close to each other and faces were the last thing they worried about it. She would send him pictures of the plant almost every day to show how it grew. There was an upcoming weekend late night fair at the beach and he had invited her to join in. He had mentioned there will be a lot of fairs around the beach and if she was still worried about showing here face then, they could still buy a mask and walk around the beach. Amaya liked the idea and was more confident in meeting him this time. She had dressed up for the occassion however, still had a mask on. She waited for him near the cotton candy machine and they, both decided to take a stroll down the fairs. They both played various games, sat in the Ferris whell and walked down the beach. Some distance further down the beach where there was no one, they both decide to lie down on the sand and look at the sky. They let the sea breeze and the clear sky captivate their night. “Hey, tell me something. Why did you name yourself Quasimodo?”, Amaya asked. “You don’t look like him. I have not seen your face but you certainly do not have a hunchback”, she added. “Well Quasimodo was a happy go luckly guy yet the world branded him for what he looked like not for what he was. I want people to know me for what I am and not for how I look”, he said. Amaya understood his words more than anyone would. “What about you? Why the hiding?”, he said. “I guess I am like you. But, I don’t have much to offer. Faces and words can be deceiving but actions won’t. I rather would want people to know me for what I do than, anything else.” she replied. “So when do you think these masks are not needed between us?”, he asked. “Eventually”, Amaya replied. They both spent time on the beach trying to enjoy what the world had to offer before they both headed off for their homes. Amaya felt happy about how close they have become and truly for rooting for things to go well from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, while taking the metro one day Amaya found that there was a Halloween themed party at a nearby disco joint this Thursday. She quickly texted him hoping to see if he would like to join her and in few minutes she got a confirmation. She decided to show herself to Quasimodo after the party and hoped she could be more open with him. She marked her calendar and went about anxiously waiting for the day in excitement. At home she looked for the best clothes she could wear and went through her wardrobe multiple times. She tried on my many clothes but none made her feel pretty. But she didn’t give up, she left home to the local clothing store and started to look for clothes. She really wanted to make this work and put in all the effort she had. Finally it was the day of the party. Amaya looked at the clock every passing moment for it to struck five so she could leave for the day and meet up with him. “Hey Amaya, how is it going? Can please help in finishing this document by today evening. It is urgent and I won’t be able to do this today. Pretty please?”, said one of her colleagues trying to pursue her to dump off her work. “But this will take the entire night. I kind of have plans today.”, Amaya replied. “Seriously! I ask for your help one time and you are not even considering my situation. I wouldn’t ask you if I couldn’t absolutely avoid this.”, replied her colleague trying to guilt trip Amaya into taking the work. Amaya felt bad that she was not helping her colleague out but this is the first time she had made plans of her own and she didn’t want to step back out of it. “Hey Stephnie, Amaya seems to have plans. Why don’t you reach someone else. I’m sure there are others who might help you out.”, came a voice from behind. Amaya turned around and found Barak walking closer to her desk. Barak is a good looking, fit, smart and overall a genuinely nice person to be around. Amaya barely talked with him other than work as he is an extremely social person around the office and she found it tough to be around with such people. If only her confidence was good as his. “Hey, overheard you have made plans for today. That’s the first time I heard you talk about something other than office work. I guess the rumors about your being very different is true.”, he smiled and wished her luck for the night as he walked away. The day had ended and she headed to powder room to change and head for the venue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amaya was at the party and waited for him to arrive. It was 10 minutes past their meet time and still no show. She grew anxious but she had trust in him. 20 mins and still no show. She tried texting him but there was no reply. She didn’t know if he was ok or if she is being stood up. Amaya felt her confidence starting to crack. 40 minutes and she was about to be in tears. She convinced herself it her fault to trust in people and that things would be any different. As she was about to head out the door opened and in-came someone panting. It was kind of dark to figure out who it was but he had a bag with a glow in the dark keychain. Kinda similar to the ones both of them got at the comic-con. “Quasimodo, is that you?”, she asked. “Bellossom, is that you? I’m so sorry for being late. I got mugged on the way from the station and had to go the police. I had no ways to reach you.”, he replied as he was catching his breathe. Amaya felt happy that he was safe and she guide him to the table where the drinks were served. She picked up a glass and turned to give it him and she had the shock of her life. The guy panting was Barak. Of all the people in the world, the one person she felt too far to reach was just an arm’s reach away. The same person she had been so constantly in touch was the same person she stayed away from at office. The confidence she had mustered blew up and she had nothing to keep her cool. “I’m sorry I have something urgent to do, I have to go now.”, said  Amaya and started to run away. “Hey! Wait”, he shouted as he tried catch up to her but she was long gone. Amaya was completely confused. As much as she wanted to know the person this ended up being someone from office and someone who she felt was light years away from her reach. “This is not how it is supposed to be. I will be ridiculed for being around him. I don’t deserve someone like him.” such words floated around her head. The reality that Barak was the one she wanted to date will be more painful to bare when it shatters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Couple of days passed by and Barak had his phone with him again. He texted her however, she did not reply. Even at office she would stay away from him. He would text her asking if things were ok and if there was something he did but she never responded. Few days passed by and Amaya stated to hit a state of depression, her lack of confidence to handle this situation and also seeing Barak being hurt in the process was too much for her to handle. She decided to end it once and for all and decide to reply to Barak. “You don’t look like Quasimodo. You are far too good looking to play his role. Pretty sure you already have a girlfriend if not many. It was nice to know you but I don’t want to be played around. Bye”, text Amaya trying to enrage him and drop off their chats. Barak tried to reason with her but it wasn’t helpful. She would just try to be as harsh as she could be but he wouldn’t back off. She decided to remove the app for good and un-installed it. Trying her best she would keep a fake smiley in office just to have the days pass by but deep inside she needed a change. To her luck and thanks to her tremendous results with her work, their office was opening a branch in another city and they wanted her there to get things moving. As wonderful as the opportunity is she was not sure if she wanted to leave things as it is or wrap it up before going. She took a day to think about it and said yes to the offer. The news spread throughout the office about her new job and everyone were happy. Even Barak, even if he was having his own problems. They wanted Amaya to move in 5 days hence, she was busy in sorting her travel and luggage and this helped her forget his problems for a while. Amaya would still wondered if she was doing the right thing. Leaving thing half way. She decided to install the App again and text Barak one last time. “Hey, I don’t know if you are still there but I wanted to apologize for everything I did or said. I will be leaving town soon so I wanted to apologize to you in person if possible. Let me know if you are still there”. “Ok. If that’s how it is then, fine. We can meet up one last time.” he replied. They decided to have a dinner at a themed restaurant on the day before she had her flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last day of the office and farewell party for Amaya to remember. Just before Amaya left for office she was able to see the Bonsai tree bloom with flowers. It reminded her of many things between her and Barak. She had finally made up her mind on what she wanted to do. Food, drinks and music during lunch was the agenda. It was a wonderful party for everything to remember. She was way more outgoing than usual. She would go and greet people and take pictures with everyone. She looked at Barak and found that he had eyes on his watch every few minutes. He was more anxious about his dinner than what was going around. She quickly drops of a message to Barak stating that the theme for the restaurant doesn’t involve masks and this time it will be face to face. Barak read the message and had a sense of happiness overflow through him. She quietly walks us to him and says, “Hey Barak, what are you doing? Join me for a photo. I might not get someone as helpful as you around there.”. Barak shook his head and smiled for the camera as she took her selfie with him. The day was about to end however, Amaya had some last minute work to sort out before she could leave. She asked for Barak to help and as much as he wanted to leave early he decided to stay back to help her out. It was Six P.M. and it was time for him to leave, luckily all work was wrapped up. Being the only two remaining they decided to walk towards the elevator one last time. As they entered the elevator Barak’s phone buzzes with a notification. It was a message from Bellossom, “I am sorry it took so long for me to confront my emotions. I am sorry I made you wait out for so long just to see me leave. I am not sure if I am still good enough for you. But, I do hope I can make you smile just like you are this picture with me.” The message was followed by picture attachment, A selfie of both of them from today. Barak looks up at Amaya. “So Quasimodo I hope you are still up for the dinner with someone like me?”, she said. The elevator door slowly closed but anyone outside would have got to see Barak smile at Amaya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIN.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>White Shadow</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I lay on my bed trying to fall asleep however, it looks like this will take time. “I should not have had that much of caffine this late at night. Looks like I am going to have a terrible morning”, I said to myself. I got off my bed and walk towards my balcony where there is a hint of moon light. With a mild breeze blowing by here I stand at my apartment balcony 6 stories high, looking out into the city. A big flat here out in the states with exotic decor and fine art around. It nice to be an independent women working at the higher ranks of a corporate office. I turn myself and my head towards the floor and I see the shadow my body makes with the light the moon has to offer. You see shadows when there is light however, I remember seeing a white shadow once during the early days of my life. One that haunted me everywhere I went. One that was even visible in pitch darkness. One that made we fear everything around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was few years back I suppose, I just moved to the city to work. From a small town with people you know being just around the corner of the road. But the city was big and roads stretched for miles. People from near and far you would see, someone new everytime on the same street. I had just joined my company right after my community college and that too away from home. I was learning to stand on my own feet, it was me against the big world. I had moved into a place near by the office to avoid the hassle of travel. Learning the ways of my works was like catching the bullet train with a small hook. It would start at dawn and end at night. All I could do was catch up and wait for the weekend so that I could hit my bed before the next week started. Luckily I had few familiar people in the city like my housemate, Emma and few of my college contacts. I would be dead tired and a weekend on my bed looked to be more soothing however, I would head out once in a while. Not because I wanted to but because I would be dragged around by the circle of people I knew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one Friday night we all headed out to a local food joint. Random classic hits and dimmed light, the restaurant tried its best to please it crowd however, it was too mundane like the rest I have been to. I always saw my circle talk about their insane week and their insane job and here I am waiting to hit my bed once this meetup was done. While these guys talked someone approached our table. “I think I have seen him before”, I thought to myself. It was another chap from my college. I would have probably met him like few times. People recognized him and he joined in with us, the whole gang then continued with their chatter. “How are you doing, Grace?”, he asked. “Wait, how does he know my name?”. “You probably don’t remember but we had few classes together. I’m Adam”, he said. Apparently he had just moved to the city a week ago. My energy levl was low so I tried to meet the necessary meet n’ greet and headed home to catch on my zzes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new week was in dawn and I was back on my usual schedule, running to office and back home. One day while returning home I found my housemate outside our place talking to someone. As I walked closer I got a glimpse of the person. It was that guy from the restaurant. “Hey! Good Evening.”, he said. “Hey Grace, guess who’s is now our street mate”, Emma said. “His office was nearby and he too was looking for a place. We have been place hunting on craigslist and finally we got one. That too just opposite to our place”, Emma was cheerful as now there is someone she can spend time with when she returns home early. “When did you two get so close”, I asked. “Oh I have been in touch with him on Facebook ever since he moved here. That’s how he joined us during last weekend. I told him we were all there. I thought I told you this”. It made sense now but I was too tired to be excited for you. “I hope we get along better”, he said. “Sure. Of course”, I said as I smiled with the few ounce of energy I had and walked into my house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now every evening when I returned, I would see these two out talking on the street. They would invite me over for a talk and I tried avoiding it as I was exhausted from work. However, after few days I started to join them after a quick wash to freshen up. They would walk up and down the street where we had few trees and a row of street lights. It was just a casual set of talks and all I did was walk. I had no interest in sharing my life draining office story. I would prefer to lay on my bed and wait for the next day to start. “You know, you shouldn’t lay on your bed once you are back from work. Try going for a walk. It would help you sleep better.”, he said. “Wait, how does he know what I do once I come back from office. Am I that readable?”, I thought to myself. That’s fine I don’t do it always, I said. As we made a final turn before heading home a gentle breeze had brushed off all the trees and us. “Is that lavender I smell”, he said. “Lavender’s are always better than roses. Do you girls also feel the same?”, he said took deep breathe. Asides from the creepy fact that he just sniff out my body wash’s flavor he also seems to know what it was. It’s odd, I just changed the flavor just yesterday. Clearly he shouldn’t be able to guess it out. May be I am just over thinking. “It doesn’t matter which was better, in any case they both are great flowers”, I said as I wrapped up my walk and headed home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Office work grew a bit softer now. May it is because I am starting to get a hang of this. Also, I was able to meet some pecuilar people in office, interesting ones I must say. For unknown reason I started to jelly quite well with them and now I was part of a pack of 3 people. Truth be told I may call it an achievement based on how I unsually am among my peers. We have a small group in our Facebook messengers and we would crack a lot of silly jokes. It was addictive. I had the habit of texting these guys while I had that evening walk. I would be glued to my screen more instead of interacting with the other two walking with me. “Hey, instead of messaging Blake and Ruby you should look where you are going”, he said. “Hey, don’t you know it not nice to look into other people’s phone.”, I stated. “I just wanted to know what tickled your funny bone. I didn’t mean to intrude.”, Adam said as he apologized for his behavior. I decided to cut short my walk and headed back for the night. As days went by I skipped the evening walk as I was getting more comformtable just texting these two folks. However, Adam started to slowly text me. If only my housemate hadn’t given my number to him that day. Since we cross paths on every other day I would usually drop off one word responses. However, his texts were always creepy. He would ask me if I had my toast and eggs in the morning. He would ask me to wake up early instead of running to office at near office hours. He would ask me to sit up straight and not curl up while I watched netflix. Asked me if I had read my book in the night before I slept. It was weird that he knew my habits so well. When, I asked him how he knows he would say my flatmate said it out when he talked with her during the evening walks. I am not sure if it were true however, she did have the tendency to be an open mouth. It was my mistake to take these things lightly as things started to become a bit too intense soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blake and I kind of started having some kind of chemistry. I didn’t want to rush into it like an idiot but I did feel cupid did float around me. I started to text him a lot privately over SMS and called him too. I didn’t know if he felt the same however, I hoped we were on the same boat. One evening my flatmate called Adam over for movie night. I was not interested however, she dragged me into it as well. I was engrossed in texting Blake and gave very little presence to the people around. “Grace could you stop texting Blake for sometime and try enjoying the movie with us. You two have your date tomorrow right, nothing to sweat about it today”. Adam’s comment swept a shock down my spine. “How did he know I was texting Blake? How did he know we have plans for tomorrow?”, these thoughts ran though my head as I was both angry and scared at the same time with Adam. “How do you know this?”, I exclaimed. “I am friends with Blake too”, I talk a lot with him. We go to same sports arena. Has he not told you this yet?”, Adam said. I immediately checked Blake’s friends list and he was right. I texted Blake asking him about knowing Adam and he said yes. I didn’t know why would Blake hide this nor why Adam know such details. I was worried a bit of my privacy now as Adam knew things and he was the last person that I wanted to know about me. I wanted to tell Blake not to share stuff however, I didn’t want him to think I was a control freak. I decided to let it slide however, I was not happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week passed, me and Blake had plans to watch a movie. It was a comedy movie and the review was bad. Blake let me be in charge of the day plan and I purposefully booked a crappy movie so we would have less people around in the theater so could get a bit more cozy. The movie started and as we got comfortable I got a call. I picked up my phone and checked, it was Adam. I felt annoyed and kept it back. Once the call ended, he dialed again, and again. I got furious and just switched off my phone. Few minutes later Blake got a call. “Don’t pick up his call” I said but, Blake insisted that he picked up. He answered the phone and then, quickly grabbed my hand and we both went out. I was puzzled with his actions. “Emma is hurt and hospitalized”, he said. We both rushed to hospital to see her. Adam stood there and had a rage on his face. I went to check on Emma and avoided him as much as I could. She was unconsious. “She tripped and fell while he was moving things around”, Adam said. “Stop being so obsessed with your own life and answer people’s phone when they call. You are too naive to quickly judge people and their character. For once try to care about others too.”, Adam words were harsh and pricked my consciousness. Adam offered to stay beind and watch over Emma while Blake decided to drop me off home. “May be I am just paranoid with Adam. He might be just a bit too close to people around him.”, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Blake dropped me off, he headed to his house. I thought he would give me company however, looks like it did not strike him then. In the end I had a miserable night that day. I couldn’t sleep and to add on it I felt someone breathing down my neck. After being restless for hours I woke up. It was 3am in the morning. I looked around my room cause I felt something was off however, I didn’t find anything. I walked out of my room and down the hall. I found Emma’s phone. I unlocked it with her childish security lock of 1290 which was nothing more than her date of birth which she used for most things. I looked at her notifications and I found a lot of messages, messages from Blake. Wait, Blake told he hated texting on facebook. Even when the group started he had would only join in during the night from his laptop. But he has been texting Emma all the time. Flirting as well. I didn’t know what was going on. I headed back to my room to try and sleep of my confusion for now. May be I will check on this tomorrow. I layed on my bed however, I fell a glare of eyes on me constantly. Eyes that could pierce through my blanket and dead at me. With no sleep seen for minutes I had taken my pillow and headed to the hall where I slept on my couch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next day at work I decided to check into Blake’s laptop when he was not around. I quickly opened his Facebook messenger and there wasn’t a single chat history with Emma. “Wait does it mean he talks to her and delete it after that?”. I then found his texts with Adam. It looked like Blake did talk to Adam a lot however, nothing out of the ordinary. However, there was one small set of interactions though. Talking about looking at unsecure CCTV camera. Blake seems to know quite a bit on how to take access of these camera. Looks like Adam found a link about it and Blake knew about it long before. Blake even talked on how there are ways to view webcams as well and how he had done that in college with few of his mates. I started to doubt if I really knew Blake well. First the deleted chats with Emma, now talks about snooping in on webcams. Is he trustable?, I thought. I quickly closed of his tabs and then, deleted the history before I returned back to my place. In the evening I went to visit Emma however, she was still unconsious. We had called her parents and they have decided to take her home to help her recover. I helped them pack her stuff from her room and while doing so I found a shirt that looked like Blake which he worn on our first date. Blake has never been inside our house. Even on that day when he dropped me off. How is his shirt here?, I thought. I hid the shirt and helped Emma’s parents collect here stuff and leave for the night. Now I was in this big apartment, alone with my thoughts that worried about my own safety. I decided to take a shower and then, probably hit the bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once my shower was done I went to my bed. I closed my eyes yet I had too many thoughts for which answers were not there. The feeling of glaring eyes was still there and it was haunting me as well. I felt unsafe in my own house. Few minutes later, the stress was killing me and I was out of my mind. I decided to head home and probably call in sick for the week. I started to packet my stuff and dashed for my door. As I opened the door I found Blake outside. “Hey, I wanted to check in on you. I heard Emma’s parents came by to collect her things. Are you ok?”, he asked. I was not sure whom to trust or what to do. “I am not feeling right. I am going home”, I told and tried to walk past him. He caught my arm trying to calm me down however, fear was the only thing I felt. While stuggling to let him go of my arm, I dropped my bag and also made him go off balance and fall too. I quickly collected my things and just fled the place without helping him. “Blake is probably mad at me right now. I should have at least apologized”, I thought yet I was still walking to the closest bus stop. My natural instincts was asking me to leave this things behind for now. I quickly boarded the first bus that took me to my hometown and left for home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached my home and my parents were surprised that I was here at this hour. I told them I got home sick. I didn’t want them to worry about what was happening. I went to my room and started to unpack. While unpacking I found another phone in my bag. “Wait this belongs Blake. Did I end up grabbing this as well”, I thought to myself. I just landed on my bed with a half unpacked bag on the side. As I tried to close my eyes. I got a message on my phone. “Hey, you went home? What happened? Are you ok?”, it was Adam. “How did he know? There is no ways for him to know this.” I texted him back asking how he knew where I was to which he replied Blake called me just sometime back as he was worried about you. “Which number?”, I followed up. “His cellular number, he has only one phone. Don’t you know that.”, he replied. I quickly flipped opened Blake’s phone and made a call to Adam. Hello, he said. “It’s me, Grace!”, I exclaimed. “Now tell me how you got to know I am at my home when Blake’s phone has been with me the whole time!”, I was furious as I raised my questions. I wanted to stop this game once and for all. “Grace, you should not sleep on your bed in such an awkward position you know. It is not good for your spine”. I was shocked. How???. I slowly got up off my bed as I started to look around my room. “Blake is not good for you. You deserve someone better. Someone who would appriciate you for what you are. For looking pretty even in your blue PJs. I see you for what your are. I always watch over you, Grace”, he said. I slowly turned and looked at my desk. I had a desktop in my room on which I had a webcam. I moved the phone closer to my chest as I walked to it. The PC was locked then, how?. I turned Blake’s phone speaker ON and placed it on my desk. “Grace, I have always admired you every since I met you for the first time. You shined so bright that it was so hard for me to even come close to you. Then, I got a chance to be with you in one of our classes however, the other guys always hovered over you. Those guys never deserved you. I knew you would not fall for their tricks and I was right. You were always so pure. But then, you moved to the city and left me behind. It took a while to track you down. It was nice that Emma had the tendancy to post eveything on Facebook. It was easy to track you from there on. I managed to move to city and kept in touch with her. I got her help to find a place close by so we could be close again. You remember our evening walks. They were so wonderful but then, you slowly started to mingle with Blake. He is not right for you. I know so many things about him that you would never know. Things that he would never share. I tried to make sure you would spend time with me and me alone but you never thought of me did you. Do you know how peaceful you look when you sleep. You sleep like an angel. Its a shame though, Emma ended up knowing about someone visiting your house often in the night. She tried to stop me one day from meeting you but she ended up falling and becoming unconsious in the process. I’m lucky she didn’t see my face. It would have been a shame if she did. Who know what I would have to do to keep it a secret. You also saw Blake’s texts and shirt in her cupboard, right. I told you didn’t I he is not right for you. But now that Emma is gone we two can be together and Blake won’t bother us”. Adam’s words were baffling beyond my dreams and had scared me to corner of my mind. His obsession was something I have read and see only in the movies. I realized he has been stalking me for a long time. Make moves so it looked natural. Planning things to make me think of something else is wrong. With whatever courage I had I confronted Adam. “If you ever come close to me or text me I am going to report you to the cops with this call recording. YOU HEAR ME, DO NOT CONTACT ME EVER AGAIN!”, I said from the top of my voice. “But you are on Blake’s phone Grace, that is a silly phone. That doesn’t have recording feature.”, he said. “ I know but mine had”, I said and pulled out my phone from my sleeves. I had the recording started the moment he started to talk about me being in my blue PJs. I realized he saw me so I had to keep it hidden away so he wouldn’t have to know I had something up my sleeve. I placed Blake’s phone in speaker as I needed his voice to captured as well. “YOU HEAR ME, IF I EVER SEE YOU OR HEAR FROM YOU I WILL REPORT YOU! DO NOT CONTACT ME EVER AGAIN!”, I cut the call and pulled off the cable from the socket for my computer. I also switched off the phones after this. Now, there was finally peace and I dropped dead on the floor with my dead legs. I do hope its done for good now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few days later, I headed back to the city. Still fearing he would be there, I was trying to be caution as I reached my place. Emma was back and told she got attacked by someone but she couldn’t see who it was. Adam had left the city and there were no traces of him at the place he stayed. The company he talked about working for never hired him as well. As for Blake, it did not work out in the long run. He may have been nice but he truely wasn’t meant for me. May be Adam was right on that one. It has been 8 years since then. I still wonder what was Adam’s true intensions. He had stalked me out a lot however, he had not hurt me physically or abused me. However, his presence had left a lasting impression on my mind on men and their intensions. I slowly look back into my room and I got a message on my phone. A sense of fear suddenly ran through my spine. Wait, why am I feeling this one again. Is it the paranoia from thinking about my past. I walked slowly to my nightstand that was besides my bed. I picked up the phone which was facing down and slowly turned it upright. I had a look at the screen and finally had a sign of relief. It was my mom texting me Good Night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIN.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Final Symphony</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Its been only few days since I moved to the big city yet, I am already take aback by the shear number of people and things that it brings. Being from a small town you would wonder how a small teen such as myself would survive on his own at this place. However, this is something I must do. I am done with the country life and the monotone life it brings. I had to leave all of it and make something of my own. Obviously my parents were against it but, I did not care for their opinion. I was meant to reach excellence someday and for that I must leave things behind that would drag me back. For now, I have small apartment in an alley that could pretty well be good enough for Jack the Ripper to make it his playground. Working part time while I pursued my goal in the acting field makes it quite challenging for me. I would have to travel a lot and luckily I live in the era where we have metro trains to travel long distances and walkmans to keep us company. I always dream of having a luxurious lifestyle with expensive cars and exquisite art work around me to remind myself and others that I am a man of great taste. But this has to wait, till I get my first break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyday I would wake up, get ready and then head to the metro. I had exactly 5 mix tapes to keep me company during my stay here in the city. The metro was around 2km from where I stayed so I would always have a quick breakfast on-route and then, reach the place by 8:45am. My first metro was at 9am so I had few minutes to spare before my rough day started. Today was different though. My walkman had run out of battery half way through and I was introduced to the chaotic voices of the city. As I reached the tunnel to the metro station platform I could hear a faint sound of violin. As I went closer and closer to the platform the sound grew louder and louder. At the platform I finally met the source of the music. An elderly guy may be in his 60s stood next to a wall as he played his violin. The music had it own sense of softness and sadness to it. Some travelers stood and watched while the others just walked by. Few gave money to the old man while few didn’t. His clothes weren’t that shabby to make his poor but why would someone play music at the station during its busy hours, I wondered. My train had arrived and I dropped few pennies and left for work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next day I reached the station and found him again but I was a bit late so all I could was run and board my train. I looked at him while the train left the station. I wondered if he did this everyday. I decided to look for him during my return that is if, he were still around. Part-time job and acting classes were never easy yet I do manage what I can. The sun had set and it was my time to head back. I reached the station however, he was no where to be found. “I guess he works only during the day”, I said to myself. I headed home and decided to sleep off the night and await for my busy life the next day had in store. On route to my apartment I had gotten a call on my phone. I flipped open my phone but, I didn’t answer it though. It was my dad. He had a habit of calling me on odd days to check in on me. “He never approved of my wishes so why try and reach me”, I said to myself and closed my phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weekend was nearing by and I usually used to go the near by theater where people auditioned for roles. However, the old man’s behavior intrigued me for some reason. I decided that today I will go and play detective, see what he does and probably follow him around. I headed to the station by 6am. It was a very cold day. If it weren’t for my jacket I would be freezing my bottom off. I reached the station and as suspected he wasn’t there. I waited outside the metro station however, I wondered if he would come today. I decided to light off a cigarette while I waited in this cold weather. It was 7am and the weather was warming up but not enough to walk around without a jacket. I had decided to wait off somewhere else when I spotted someone walking towards the entrance. I moved next to a wall near by and watched while I covered my face with my muffler and my hat. An old man, carrying a case, shivering while walking towards the entrance with his wooden cane. To top it off the jacket he wore was thin. I don’t think that is enough for such weather why would he wear this and head over here in this cold time, I wondered. I could see his old body shook during every single step. I followed him slowly as he walked upfront. He walked up to the wall where he always stood. He kept his case down and slowly opened it up. With his shivering hands he picked up his violin and placed it against his chin. With his hands still shaking he brought the bow up close to the violin and after one strong exhale he started to play. Wait, it was only 7:30am. I had seen play at around 8:30am even at close to 9:00am too. Surely, he was not playing it all this while, I thought to myself. I waited at one of the benches and just listened to his music from the side. He played and played and played. He would occasionally take a break to drink water that was available from the nearby water fountain however, that’s it. He would shiver for most part of his walk and even while placing his violin yet he was in complete control when he played it. People passed by and while few dropped their money some didn’t. This continued till 10am and he finally stopped. The station was filled such wonderful music for so long yet many failed to enjoy it. He loaded the money into his pockets and started to place his violin and bow back into the case. He picke dup his violin and then slowly started to walk out of the station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed him to see what next was in store for such a talented old man. He went to a near by bakery and bought some bread and tea. He had his share on his way to the pond near by that was close to the public park. There he sat at a bench while feeding the ducks, pigeons and even squirrels with the bread that he had bought. It was odd that one would spend all of the money they had earned in one go. He relaxed himself to the sight of the nature around him, the raft of ducks that swam around the pond, the flock of pigeons that flew in and out when someone walked by the place where the bread crumbs were thrown, the scurry of squirrels running around the park and onto the trees. He had a smile on his face while he watched all of these yet all I saw was sadness in his eyes. Once his bag of bread was emptied he crushed the bag and dropped it off at the waste-bin while he walked away. I followed him till he eventually went to an old age home. I had way too many questions for which I had no answers for. I went back to the baker shop to see if I could get some details that would ease my mind. I checked with the baker and I learned that this was his daily trend. It has been few months since this activity had started. The baker did not know much however, he did say that the old gentleman would play his violin every day at the station not for money for something else however, he was not told for why though. I needed answers and hence, I had decided that I would confront him tomorrow if he shows up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its a Sunday and here I am waking early again. “I should be in bed”, I told myself. I got ready and headed out for the station.  Just like yesterday, he was at the station by 7am and started playing his violin. Being a Sunday the number of people were less however, he still played on till he wrapped it up at 10 o’clock. I could see that the money he got today was fairly little and yet he still went to the bakery and bought bread and tea with all he got. I followed him till the park and then, walked up to him after he had sat at his bench. “Hi, sorry to have followed you but I wanted to talk to you about few things. Benjamin is my name.”, I said. “He was probably confused since I said I followed him but, he greeted me with a smile and made me sit besides him. He also offered a slice of bread even though there wasn’t any to eat it with. I was happy with his offer and took a slice of bread but, I started to feed the animals along with him. “I see you come to the station everyday to play your violin and that too for long hours yet, you use up all the money you earned in feeding the birds and animals. Why? What if you are sick and you cannot come over for a day or two? How would you feed yourself?”, unconsciously all my questions even the more weird ones were spilled out. He started to talk and we conversed for hours. After a while, I walked with him back to the old age home and we talked for a while there too. After few minutes I bid farewell and headed back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the night as I lay in my bed I felt a weight on my chest. The old man stories had an impact on me. He was once an aspiring musician from a small town who had moved to the city to become big in life. He met the love his live and had a wonderful baby girl child. However, the problem of all aspiring people struck him as well, which is time. He was unable to devote time to his family and this led down a spiral stairs till it reached the fork on the road. Unfortunately, he wasn’t available when his wife made a decision to leave him and head back to her hometown with their kid. He tried to become big by taking shortcuts however, it was down an alley that lead him to prison for mistakes that he had not done. Being out off prison after 30 years he is now at a stage where both fame and happiness are outside his grasp. He knows where she stays and sent letters across to check on them however, the letters never had any responses. There was few stations that this metro connected which they could board on to reach where he is. He had mentioned in the letter that he would be at one of the station waiting for them and to know it his him he would play his violin.  It is odd that things could change from something to nothing and you could do so little to control it. While thinking of all of these, I got a call from my dad yet, my thoughts were so deep that ring-tone fell on my deaf ears. I closed my eyes to head to sleep with my mind set on what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;good-ending&quot;&gt;Good Ending&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a new week at hand I woke up and headed for work. The walkman that kept me company for all these days remained in my pocket. I went by the metro station where the old man played his violin. I waited at the platform for my train while I heard his words play out on musical cords all over the station. My train arrived and I boarded for work without looking back. I started to spend long hours and worked more than I would normally would. I would return back at around 10pm in the night and then, just go straight to bed out of exhaustion. The next day would start and I would go through this cycle again and again. I did this for 2 weeks. I could tell I was moving as fast as I could. I had a purpose which was not for my own for a change and I wanted to see if I could fulfill it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a Sunday and I think I had what I needed. I wore my clothes and headed to the station by 7am. It was still a cold day however, it was warmer than usual. I waited by the station for the old man to come by. He was more or less on the dot and I went straight to him before he took out his violin to do his daily task. “Sir, do you remember me?”, I asked. He nodded his head with a smile. “I have something for you”, I said while I opened his palm and placed two tickets. “I remember you had told me where your wife and daughter might be staying at. Well these are the tickets for your to go and meet them”. You could see a bit of hesitance in his eyes as he looked at the tickets. “I know money was never a problem for your yet you never went to visit them. That is fine. I will be joining you. You don’t have to do this alone if you are worried on how it would turn out to be.” He tried to smile yet one could tell the roller coaster of emotions which was going through him. I grabbed his violin as we both waited for our train to arrive. He remained silent through out our journey. I knew what I did could turn out to be really horrible however, a closure would be a better answer than an indefinite wait. We reached our station and took a cab to reach the house. At last, we are here. The moment of truth. His footsteps were heavier than before as we walked up the porch and up to the front door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He took a long breathe and then, paused before he could knock at the door. He tried to turn back but I held his arm. Before he could utter a work the front door opened. “How can I help you mister? Are you here to meet mommy?”, said a small girl barely 5 or 6 years old. Neither of us knew who this kid was. We heard footsteps reach the main door. “Samantha, how many times do I tell u….”, a voice flew by as the door opened further. There stood a lady may be in her thirties look at both of us while holding the child by her arms. There was a sudden silence around the place as the lady and the old man looked at each other. “Who is this mommy? Do you known him?”, said the little girl. Tears flew down her eyes as she said, “Yes, this your grandpa sweety. Go say hi to him.” There were tear rolling down all our eyes now. The old man crouched as he hugged the little girl and then, he hugged his daughter. “We didn’t reply to your letter cause we were mad at you. But it doesn’t mean you could never come home”. “I’m so sorry”, he said as he hugged her tight. We entered the house as the door behind us closed. Now I knew that his music would never fall on stranger’s ears rather, only the ones he would want it to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bad-ending&quot;&gt;Bad Ending&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a new week at hand I woke up and headed for work. The walkman that kept me company for all these days remained in my pocket. I went by the metro station where the old man played his violin. However, he was not there today. It was odd of him to not be there but I waited at the station for my train. My train arrived yet he was still not there. It was a very cold day and I had to wear multiple layers to keep me warm. May be he didn’t want to or couldn’t do it in such a bad weather, I told myself. The train left the platform and I was off to work. I did long hours of work and headed for home late at night. I dragged my body till I hit my bed. The exhaustion of working long hours had its toll on me and I fell asleep in the same clothes I wore. I woke up the next and got ready. I went to the station a bit early today and he still wasn’t there. “Two days in a row, something is not right”. I quickly rush towards the old home to see him. I reached there and I found him on his bed. He had slipped and fell yesterday while leaving for the station. To make it worse he fell off the stairs outside the home and hit his head pretty bad. I tried to speak to him but all he did was smile and node his head a little. A doctor did come by yesterday however, he said much could not done. “If he doesn’t get back on his feet in 3 days then, there is not much we can do”, apparently were the words of the doctor when he left yesterday. I sat next to him the entire day to see if he would recover however, he didn’t. Every single breathe of his were heavy and quite painful, painful to watch as well. I left for home in the evening while I worried for him. This ‘concern’ was new to me and I did not know from where this came from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next day I went to the station and booked a ticket for myself. I decided to go the address to which the letters were sent to. Upon reaching there I was greeted with only more disappointment. The house was empty and put for sale. I checked with neighbors to see if they had any information however, no one has been there at this house for years apparently nor did they know where they went. I asked a couple of neighbors for any contact address or number however, non had any. I went to a public phone and started flip thought the yellow pages to look for any name that matched the wife’s middle or last name. There was 1 name that kind of matched however, I was not sure. I took out my phone and made a call to it. It rang and rang however, no one picked it up. I told the neighbors about the old man and if anyone did come by to ask them to come to the old home to see him. I had to leave the place as I could do nothing else at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I skipped work again and went over to the old home to see him. He was definitely not improving. I wanted to take him to the park nearby but he was too weak to move. All I could do is sit next to him and watch him fade away slowly. I flipped open my phone and made calls to the number few times however, it was never picked up. I stepped away from the room so I could vent my frustration out on something. I made one last call and then, went back in. I tried to talk my story with him to give him the very little comfort that I could offer and all he did was smile. I didn’t know if my words did reach him but I hope it did. I continued with my story and I heard fast paced footsteps nearing by. “Dad, are you here?”, a voice was heard from near the door. A women, probably in her mid thirties walked in and sat next to him holding his hand. “I’m sorry, I didn’t know.” , she said. The old man had tears rolling by eyes as he looked at the women, “I’m so sorry for the things I put you through” he said with all the energy he had. They sat there in silence for few minutes looking at each other till he slowly he faded away with a smile on his face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Benjamin do you think this was right? Tricking him like this?”. “Honestly Lorien, I don’t think being right or wrong matters anymore”. “I don’t know if he could tell if you where his daughter or not. Even if he did, I don’t think there is a point to it.” He has been though a lot and I don’t want it to end it such a way. My conscious is fine with what I did and that is all that I care for. People make mistakes but does it mean it should haunt us for the rest of our life. I heard my phone ring and I flipped it open, it was my Dad calling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIN.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hosting On Github</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, since I managed to get this up and running. I decided I will go ahead and just jot down the things I did to get this working. This is not a copy paste kind of article however, pointers on how you could take it about to make it work. I will highly recommend that you do your research when hosting your site. There are tons of way to do the same thing. Some site are jaw dropping when you mix JS, CSS, HTML5 hence, take your time to make the site to suit you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pre-requisites&quot;&gt;Pre-requisites:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHub Account
It is free for hosting public repository so nothing much to lose.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understanding the basic concepts and commands of GitHub
I started off by going through the following Youtube playlist. Simple and cool to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3usJuxZZUBdjAcilgfQHkRzW&quot;&gt;Git/Github Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Basic idea on writing HTML websites or working with static site generator such as ‘Jekyll’ 
I went with Jekyll since it looks to be easier than writing my own HTML code. The following Youtube playlist was awesome to understand a lot of things in a very short time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB&quot;&gt;Jekyll - Static Site Generator | Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;steps&quot;&gt;Steps:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a repository in the format&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;github_username&amp;gt;.github.io&lt;/code&gt; :&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;eg) My GitHub username is ‘akhilbaburaj’ hence, my repository is ‘akhilbaburaj.github.io’
This would be the repository where all you website(s) are hosted. Yes, you can host multiple sites however, the path will be unique if you want to view different sites. Currently, I have no plans to host multiple sites hence, I am hosting the entire site on root repository path(/).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create your HTML pages or copy paste your HTML files(eg. index.html) to your repository folder on you local machine. Since I went with Jekyll, I used it to create a folder named as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;github_username&amp;gt;.github.io&lt;/code&gt; eg. ‘akhilbaburaj.github.io’. Jekyll creates a default template of files so it is quite easy to host the template and contents for future articles as well. With help from Jekyll you can test it locally as well before making the commit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use GitHub CLI or GitHub Desktop to update your repository:
This should allow you to pull, add, change, commit and then push the files to your repository.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the files are pushed, give it some time before trying to load the page on your browser using the URL &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://&amp;lt;github_username&amp;gt;.github.io/&lt;/code&gt; eg.&lt;a href=&quot;http://akhilbaburaj.github.io/&quot;&gt;http://akhilbaburaj.github.io/&lt;/a&gt;. If things are hosted fine then, your still will officially online for public use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; You can see that the theme I used does not match the default theme provided by Jekyll. There are tons of Themes available for free and you can use them too however,to test you would have to ‘jekyll build’ and ‘jekyll serve’ in the folder when you have your theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to use custom domain like ‘example.io’ then, please make to update your DNS records and also the CNAME file. This setting can be configured from your repository’s setting section (not. your account/profile section). For more steps please follow the steps mentioned in GitHub’s official document:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/adding-or-removing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/&quot;&gt;Adding or removing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps you in directing your path on hosting on GitHub. There are tons of other articles online however, I will recommend that you do go for the most latest article as GitHub has changes quite a bit and some of the earlier steps mentioned are not explicitly required anymore to achieve the same task.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pictures</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As I sit on this couch I see the picture on the wall it is when I realized, time moves so slow when you wait for someone. Someone may not be right word since I know who it is that I am waiting for. Pretty sure it has been few years since I last saw him.. sat with him.. walked with him. I knew him since he was just a kid. He was such a small boy, so active, so full of life. He is nice, kind and genuinely a wonderful person all around. We have a picture of our first meet to remind me of him everyday of my life. It was at the park across the street during an early monsoon. The wind blew hard and I was going to meet my new family. It was going to be a new start for me with them. I was nervous yet with a hope that things would eventually work out. As I walked towards them, I saw him, a small boy with a missing tooth. I was cautious as I took my steps towards them. They were a wonderful family yet a part of held me back. We spent few hours in the park so I could know them better and be comfortable, that’s when he said, ‘Hey Max! Want to play?”. I guess I did not need an introduction by judging the way he just gave me a nickname. “Was Maxine too long to being with?”, I though. To not look rude I decided to follow him for a while and few minutes later, I had naturally started to enjoy his company. Ever since then, I always wanted to be by side as much as possible. We grew up together and we had our beds in the same room so even the nights were also fun. We would secretly stay up late and watch TV together till one day we got caught by mom. Boy was she mad at us but it was fun while it lasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was never physically strong but he sure was strong doing everything that was right. He never had a commanding height nor size, yet he was always caught in fights. I have see him come home with bruises after his school fights. I am pretty sure they hurt a lot but he would scrub it off saying it doesn’t. I am sure he was just standing up for his friends who were the ones getting bullied and being the kind of person he is I bet he would get involved only to get beaten up. I wanted to go with him to his school to show those bullies a piece of my mind but he wouldn’t let me go with him. I guess he was trying to be protective of me even then. It sure wouldn’t be the first time for him. I didn’t go to the same school as him but I did hope I did. His high school years were the not best part of his life. Bad company lured him and he became distant with us. It was tough to spend time with him as he spent less time with his family and me. It would try to chase away his friends when they would come to see him however, this only grew my distance with him to a point everything stopped between us. But luckily there was someone else who stepped into his life during the same time. Elin managed to bring him back but, I didn’t know should I be happy or sad. Should I be happy that he is back to being the nice person he was or sad cause he has someone new one his life who may well be the better half of his life. One day finally got to meet her when he brought her over to our home. She was really sweet and they both made a great pair. All I could do is join them from time to time and hope for the best. The trip to the beach was one of my most fondest memory. We took our picture as the sun sat in for the night. It truly was a wonderful day. However, lives do have their ups and down. During college Elin had to leave town and they ultimately they had to break up. He was sad and filled with sorrow. I did what I could but I knew he needed time and certainly someone else other than me. I wanted to let him know that he would meet someone just like Elin, someone who would be there with him but he never could understand what I told him nor was he ready to understand. All I could do was hope that he would be fine again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the end of his final semester he was finally ready to take on the world as a grown adult. He looked for jobs near-by but nothing clicked. He finally did get one but it was out of town. It was great but, this meant that he would have move out. The separation was expected but I didn’t know it could hurt this much. He said he would come frequently to visit us but I know that would change and it did. He was getting caught up with work and he had cut-down the time to visit us. I wanted to call him but then, I hesitated. Mom used to call him once in a while but it would land in a voice-mail. We didn’t know if he was busy or if he was being distant. I would wait for him to do video chat just to see him and when he did he never looked happy. I wanted to go over to his place but I didn’t want to be a burden. In a year’s time he told us over the call that he had quit his job to join the forces. Mom and dad were furious and they demanded that he returned. I too wanted him to back home. The home were he was truly his own. However, in the end he did leave for his camp and then his first deployment. The last picture he sent was with his uniform. I was so proud of him. He truly looked like a soldier who fights for the people. When ever I missed him I would go to our bedroom and sleep on his bed. His bed gave me some of the best memories of my life. All I could hope for him to return soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The calls were minimal and when ever he did he was on the speaker phone. He voice had life. May be this is what he was meant to do in life. He always stood for what is right and he gets to do that even now. However, it doesn’t stop the lingering thought that he may eventually be broken down by what happens on the front line, that he may change, that things might turn him for the worse or even worse that he may never return. I have lost track of time since we last spoke. I don’t know what year it is nor do I know how most of my days has goes by. Everyday I would wait at the corridor for the front door to open and hope he would be on its other side but it remains a dream. May be I have aged too fast that makes me feel as if a millennia has passed by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up today and I found that my parents has stepped out. May be they went to get the groceries. As I walked passed the hall I saw a box on the coffee table. It had his pictures in them. So many of them, so many memories flooded by as I saw them. I walked back to our bedroom and I laid down on his bed again. “I wish I could see him again”, I thought while I tried to sniff his diminishing scent off his bed. As I closed my eyes I could hear the car pull over upfront. I could hear my parents talk while they walked up the stair. Old habits don’t die that fast as I walked out of our bedroom and stood along the corridor which lead to our main door. The door opened and I saw parents enter the house, sadly no one else was there. I slowly turned my head to go back to my room. ‘Hey Max’, I heard. May be I am dreaming. I turned my head back to the corridor. I still saw only my parents but something urged me to walk towards the front door. I was being cautious again but not because I was scared rather I didn’t want to let my hallucination get the better of me. I reached the door and there he stood at our front lawn. A full grown man who is back home with the same smile I saw the first time. I was ecstatic and you could hear me bark across the street while I shook my tail in any direction it could. I ran to him to welcome home so we could be together as we used to be for the remaining life I still have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIN.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reflection</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;They say in life you grown, learn and experience a lot. I did too. Being from a small town my world was small and sweet. I knew everyone around and so did others. There was little to hide. Growing up I loved standing in front of the almara which we had. It had a huge mirror and I loved looking at myself. Anytime I needed to cheer myself up, or talk to myself, I would stand in front of it because it never lied. As time went by, I made a ton of friends. I played and enjoyed my childhood like any other kid. But we had to move to a new town eventually. My heart did sink in a bit, to be away from my friends. However, they are the type to stay in touch no matter what. We promised each other that we will always call each other and gossip our life for hours over the phone. We got help from our neighbors and friends as me and my parents packaged our luggage during our last day in town. The taxi came to pick us to the station and before boarded for it, everyone gave a big hug. I was moved as this is the first time I am leaving this town and that too for good. We boarded our train and we were to start off our new life in a new town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things were a bit off the moment we reached the final station. It was a crowded city and ever since we got down our train I felt the entire city started right at me. It was a bit uneasy at first, but I did not bother. We took a cab to our new place which already had our furniture dropped off. My parents and I took a while to settle things at their respective places. Nearly the entire day passed by and we were hungry. We decided to eat out and celebrate our new beginning. We freshened up and went to a near-by restaurant. The scene was the same, people stared at us. I know the people in the city are quite flashy with their dressing style but I knew I was not under dressed or out of style. I could hear people murmur and avoid eye contact when I looked at them. My parents told me not to be too concerned with what is happening and just asked me to enjoy the food and our time together. We reached home after a while and I stood in front of the mirror. “I don’t have anything on my dress nor does the dress look that bad.” I said to myself as I looked at my reflection as I questioned myself. In any case, I had to go see a school tomorrow which could be possibly where I would enroll myself. It had a good reputation and I wanted to go there. I changed into my PJ and went to bed so I can be ready for the big day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the alarm on my mobile going off, I finally woke up for the big day. It used to be sound of roosters which did it for me in my hometown but I guess in the city you adapt to alternate sources. With the appointment at 10am we all got ready by 8am. Before we left for the venue which could be possibly my new school, I stood in front my mirror. “You will do awesome here too!”, I said to myself as we headed outside. We reached the school in an hour’s time and the school was exactly how I imagined. I was excited to just be here. We went to meet the principal after waiting for a while. The principal looked stern and so was his tone of voice. He seemed to be reluctant to admit me into the school. I didn’t understand what his problem was but he insisted that I would not be able to handle this. I became furious when he uttered those words. “Is it because I’m a girl? Is it because I’m from a small town? Would it tarnish the school’s reputation if someone as small as I were to join such a large institute?” I wanted to voice my frustrations out however, my dad made sure my voices were heard in the right manner. He stopped me from verbally bombarding the principal and let principal say his side of the story. Once his side was done, my dad took him through his world, on how I am, on how things change one people know me, how I achieve the thing on my own. My dad has a way to pursue people in the right manner and he would make sure people see what he sees through his eyes. It did take a while, however my dad did convince the principal. I wondered if things would have worked out if I vented out my mind like I would do. I guess everything needs a special touch to work out. I was thrilled after our meet as I would be going to an awesome school in the city and I wonder what else in-store was for me in this city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my school clothes still yet to be made ready, I was allowed to join the school next day in my casual clothing. I was nervous, in schools we wear the same attire so we don’t stand out and here I am, the new kid on the block flashing out my presence bluntly to the entire school. I made sure I wore a simple dress for the big day and stood in front of the mirror for quite some time to get myself to focus. “It is fine. You look fine. You will make friends on at a time. People will like you for who you are. “, and may more. I winked at myself to finish my therapy session and headed with my dad to school. I decided to walk up to my class however, my dad insisted to accompany me. As I walked passed various classes people were looking right at me. Boy did I grab attention, I was flushed to silence. I knew that with my dad around people would notice us. I was just pacing to reach my class as quickly as possible. My dad decided to turn back half way through, I guess he realized that I was quite nervous with him around. I reached my class and stood in-front for the introduction while the entire class had their eyes set on me. My heart paced a lot to a point where I blabbered my name out. I did not needed anyone else to make me feel more embarrassed about myself as I was doing quite a good job myself. “Savitha is new to school so Tanu, please do take her around the campus to make her more comfortable with the place”, the teacher said. “Great now they are forcing someone to babysit me. I wanted to use that to break the ice and make friends. I am sure Tina would be reluctant to do so but she cannot overrule the teacher now. I guess I should say sorry to her up-front”, I thought. I sat next to her and to my surprise she was quite nice and friendly. She did not seem to mind the responsibility and we hit it off immediately. With the period coming to an end I could see more people approaching my desk. I guess people are the same everywhere. We start off with a clean slate so there is nothing to judge about unless you had your own story for them. I made quite a few friends but they were all girls though. The guys would prank around with other girls but it looked like they are caution with me. It may be because I am new and they don’t how I would react to. “That is fine”, I thought to myself. This is better than people murmuring on their own and giving me weird looks. The day ended with a couple of us girls and few guys walked throughout the school with me while we chitter-chattered girly stuff. The guys tried playing their ‘I’m too cool’ card when we walked to only be teased out by the girls. It was fun experience overall. I enjoyed this place and it was exactly as I imagined. Our walk ended at the school gate where my dad waited for me to take me home. During dinner I told my parents everything and they were happy that this place was comfortable for me. They asked me if I would like to invite my classmates over the weekend and I was thrilled to have my parents meet them. I called my town friends from the over the phone and we talked about my entire day’s story till late at night. It was very satisfying to have friends who know click with. Before I hit the bed I went to the mirror just to see my face and I loved the smile that ran across it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weekend had arrived and I had a quite a huge gang reach my place. I took them through the tour of our house and then to my bedroom where were gossiped a lot. I had a bad habit of looking at the mirror from time to time to see myself smile and my friend’s noticed this. “Hey, what’s with you and the mirror?”, they asked. I went ahead and told them my silly habit for which they laughed out of humor. Then one of the guys asked me something that was never directed to me in a long time. “Hey, how did you lose your arms?” “Stupid, how blunt can you be!!”, yelled Tanu. “You don’t have to answer that if you don’t want to”, she added. I realized that people refrain from asking this for many reasons and since I was in my hometown for a long time, most people knew the story and didn’t bother much about it. It makes sense why he was curious, he was new after all. “Just some events lead to it, that’s all”, I replied with a smile. “Cause, I am not sure how you get things done on your own.”, he said. I am sure the rest were tensed with the way he spurred out his mind and how I might take it. “Well, I am not handicapped, I am just differently-abled.”, I added. “Cool! So pretty much you are a bad ass. Nice to know!”, he replied as he smirked. I was happy that to him it was just something ‘need to know’ question to him rather than fixate an idea or an image about me. I guess even they were happy with how the entire showdown went through. There was little to none sobbing or sympathetic response from my condition because they did not see any problem with me. It takes a lot for people to interact and when you look different, people tend to act differently. At least all my friends are the same. They see me just like I see myself in the mirror. People stand in front of the mirror and take many pictures. It is not because their reflection looks better on glass but rather because that is how they truly are. You are everything that you see and even more than that. Do what you do because it takes time for people to see the true you like the reflection in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIN.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>7 Days</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“It looks the cancer has spread further. It has started to progress to her optic nerves. We must take action now and remove it or there won’t be much time left for her. Chemo therapy is no more an option”, said the doctor to Faye’s mother who is currently seeing her world crash down on her. But it was Faye who sat beside her mother, emotionlessly. This was not something new to her. Being a 9 year old girl, she was nearly confined to the hospital. Tests after tests, therapy after therapy, her life was confined to the walls of the hospital and she already had lesser interest about her future. Her lack of emotions to life was more painful for mother to face than the ordeals of her demise. “We can setup an appointment for her in a week’s time. If we are successful, this would be the last time she would have to go through any of this”, said the doctor in a decisive tone. “And what if it fails?”, asked her mother in a reluctant tone. “Well, then I am afraid we will have to go back and start our research again to look for those odd solutions”. While looking at Faye her mom agreed to the ultimatum and decided to bet everything on the surgery in hopes that would give Faye her soul back which seems to have lost its shine over the past years. While heading back to their ward Faye had something she wanted to share. “Mom, it looks like I finally will be allowed to leave this hospital for good.” These words shattered whatever ounce of strength her mother had conjured just now. Tears rolled down her eyes and she did not have anything to say. She just got up and left the room while Faye laid in her bed hoping for the week to end soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faye’s daily life revolved around where her would meet her mom in seeing her depressing mother and then sleeping the rest of the day. There was not much to do, the weather was great for one to go out and enjoy, but the warm rays from the sun could never penetrate her cold attitude. She got to meet her mom and then went ahead to fall asleep as usual. It was late evening when her sleep was disturbed by a new voice. “Hey why are you sleeping in the middle of the day? Wake up. Do you want to play? Get up you silly girl”, a boyish echoed though her room. “Get up you couch potato. God! For a girl you sure are lazy”, the comments started to make her mad and she decided to look at the person bothering her. She opened her eyes and found a boy wearing a bright red shirt, probably the same age as her grinning. “What do you want? Why are you in my room? Who are you to call me names?”, she yelled at the nuisance in front of her. “Whoa! So many questions. Who made you queen?”, said the boy smirking away after his reply. “Grrrr… Who are you? What are you doing in my room??”, Faye turned red in anger as she was beyond her limits. The boy replied, “Darwin is my name. I am new here, I’m in room 408 and was going through the floor. Doesn’t look like this place has a lot of kids around to play with. Do you want to play something with me?”. “Go away! I don’t want to play with anyone who calls me names and makes fun of me”, she replied. “Sorry, but I wanted to get your attention. You did not seem to be responding to my calls so I decided to push your buttons. But in any case, you really need to act like a kid. Only old people sleep at this hour.” Darwin’s responses only infuriated Faye as this was the first time someone talked to her this way and to top it off it was just a kid. Faye decided not to respond to the brat as she didn’t want to become a monkey in his game. “Hey, I said sorry. Why the long face? I only want to know you so I could play with you. I am not sure how long I would be here, but while I am here I thought I could use a friend. Will you be my friend?” Darwin’s approach had changed dramatically, but Faye was not ready to budge yet. “I see you are still mad. Guess, it is my fault. Sorry! I will leave now.”, said Darwin as he walked towards the door. “I will be back tomorrow once you have cooled down. Bye grumpy!”, Darwin dashed off across the hall laughing. Faye was caught by that last comment. “Wait, did he just call me with a name again? Is this kid going to bother me every day now? I cannot let this continue. Tomorrow I will show him who I’m.”, Faye was consumed by thoughts and eventually fell asleep thinking about what to do tomorrow to Darwin when he would visit her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was 9:00am in the morning, the boyish voice woke up Faye from her sleep again. “Yo! It is morning. Wake up you sleepy head.” With her half unconscious state of mind Faye opened one of her eyes and saw Darwin. It was too blurring of a vision but his annoying voice was enough to confirm it was him. “Wake up. Lets go and play.” Annoyed beyond her limit she got up on her bed and took the bottle of water from the desk besides her bed and emptied it on top of his head. “Good morning. You know you need to take a bath once you wake up”, she responded was with the most sarcastic tone possible. “You know. You are right. You should also take a bath”, Darwin started to wriggle like a dog splash the water all over the place and on Faye as well. “Now that we both have taken our bath, let’s go and play.” Stunned by his actions Faye had her jaw dropped and lost her words. “You know, it would be better if we dried ourselves first before playing. Let me go and grab us a towel”, Darwin left the room after uttering these words. Few moments later Faye’s mom stepped in and was surprised to see the wet floor and Faye. “What happened? Why are you wet?”, she questioned while wiping Faye with a dry towel. “Did you spill water when you tried to drink from it?”, concerned questions were being thrown at Faye which she was not interested to listen at this hour of the day. “I’m fine mom. Darwin was bothering me so I poured water on him. But he become a dog and splashed the water back at me.”, she replied with an annoyed tone of voice. “Darwin? Who is he? Anyways, that is not a nice thing to do. I am sure he was hurt by your actions.” Faye was under no impression to accept her mom’s comments, “I don’t think he gets hurt. He is a boy. Boys are like that. Hope he learnt his lesson for messing with me”, she replied. “Well in any case, play nice with him. I am sure he only wants to be your friend. Also, sweetie I need to visit few places this week to get your surgery ready. So please be strong for me. Mommy will always love you”, Faye’s mom kissed her forehead as she conveyed her message. “That is ok. I am used to this. You can go”, her emotionless words had hit her mom again and she left without anything else to add-on. Thirty minutes later Darwin had stepped in again with a different red shirt. “Sorry, I go held up by my mom for getting wet.”, Darwin replied as he scratched his head. “I guess you are not an outdoor person. May be you have some board games that we could play.” Before Faye could respond, Darwin scrambled though her desk and replied, “Cool! looks like you have tons of board games. Awesome!”. Faye has never met anyone like him before. It was as if someone left a wild monkey loose. At this stage she decided to tag along with the game to avoid further odd balls to be thrown at her by him. “Yeah, we can play some games”, she replied. One game after another, they spent the entire day playing board games. While she did enjoy her time, she was more pleased that she knew how to tame the wild monkey and was more content with that. “Wow! look at the time, it is getting late. Time for me to hit the bed. I really enjoyed today. Let’s do this again tomorrow”, Darwin stated as he started walking towards the door. “Same here….Wait! What!! You are coming again tomorrow?” exclaimed Faye. “Of course!” smirked Darwin as he left the room. Faye knew this won’t be stopping anytime soon. She decided to have her meal and hit the bed to fight another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 3:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faye woke up a bit early today. Not knowing what to do she had decided to formulate a plan to scare Darwin when he would approach her today. After all she should show who’s the boss. Especially for such a wild monkey. She laid towards the opposite of the bed and decided to jump scare the moment Darwin as he walk nearby. She giggled for her ingenious plan to teach him a lesson and waited for her opportunity. She heard the door open and footsteps approaching her. Once the sound was close enough she sprung up off her bed. “BOO!!” But there was no one in the room. Before she could run her eyes through the room a pair of hands grabbed her from behind. “BOOOOO!” Darwin’s attempt to scare her was successful as Faye was startled to silence. “Gotch’ ya you scaredy cat”. Faye knew who it was and turned around while rolling her fist making Darwin flinch. “Who is the scaredy-cat now??”, Faye smirked with content while waiting for his response. “I will let you take this one. But I will get my revenge.”, replied Darwin. Both laughed it out for a bit and got on with their conversation. “I have something interesting planned for us today so meet me at 10am near the emergency stairway. I have something to do now but I wanted to make sure you know that we have plans today. I will be waiting for you. You better come.”, Darwin started to pace towards the door as he finished his sentence. Faye was curious about his plans and hence agreed to meet him. Her mom visited as usual and as usual her mom had that fake smile in from Faye that she wore to show she was strong. But for a change Faye was waiting for the clock to struck 10 to go and meet Darwin. Once it struck 10am, Faye sprinted towards the emergency stairway. She found him wearing a pink shirt and this made Faye burst out in laughter. “Are you a girl to wear pink?” she said. “Color doesn’t classify gender”, Darwin uttered this as he adjusted his invisible specs to act cool. “I believe you, Darwin”, Faye grinned as she gave her response. “So what did you plan for today?”. Darwin touches Faye shoulder and utters, “TAG! You are it! Catch me if you can you slowpoke” and dashes ahead. It was a game of tag between them and Faye knew the rules already. She ran behind Darwin and they ran all over the secluded section of the hospital to avoid nuisance to others. They switched roles many times and each time Darwin would do acts like a creature when he chased her. He took forms of T-Rex, a dog, a zombie, a monkey and many more. Faye laughed each time he was IT. Faye was worn out by the end of the day with all the activities they did today. It has been a while since she had this much fun and she was enjoying it. At the end of the day they decided to head back and rest their body. “You are quite active for a slowpoke you know. I hope you enjoyed today, because I did. Let us plan something for tomorrow as well”, said Darwin. “Definitely!” she replied. She was enthusiastic about what’s in store for tomorrow. They parted ways at Faye’s room and she headed for bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 4:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a beautiful day and Faye was up early to head out and play. She had her usual visitor, her mom. Her mom was surprised to see her daughter so active in the morning. “You seem so lively today. What is it?”, her mother asked. “Nothing much. I am just waiting for Darwin to come. We planned to play today as well”, she replied. “It is so nice to know you made a friend. I wish I could meet him. When does he usually come to visit you?” her mom asked. “He should be here in another 30 minutes”, she replied. “Hmm. I wish I could meet him. But I have to leave in sometime. ‘Our’ day is closing in and there is still a lot left to do from my end. I hope to meet him soon. Hopefully, he goes to a school nearby, may be you can join him there. Remember you said you like the uniform in St. Oak junior high. May be he goes there. Wouldn’t it be lovely.” her mom replied with a smile. “May be. Let’s see how the surgery goes first”, she said. While Faye may still seem to be cold with her response it did look to be different from before. Her mom left the room to go about her usual work shortly after their small talks. “May be I should visit him in his room instead. He said it was room 408 wasn’t it”, she thought. As she headed out she bumped into Darwin while bonking their heads together. “Ouch”, they both exclaimed. “I thought you were just a slowpoke, but it looks like your blind as a bat as well. You may be need glasses that are used in telescopes”, said Darwin as he burst out a huge laughter. “You know, that was quite a dull joke you”, she said while raising her eyebrow. Darwin gave a wicked grin and proceeded in walking with Faye to the secluded section of the hospital. “Today we will play hide and seek. Rules are straight forward, we will use only this portion of the hospital to play the game.” Since Faye had less experience with the game, she hide in some of the most obvious places and Darwin used to find her in ease and under 3 minutes . He teased her quite a lot for this and Faye finally decided to take this game seriously. She decided to hide in one of the storage rooms hoping to do better in this round. 10 minutes had passed by and she was content that she was doing better in this round. “Yeah! Who is awesome now!” she thought. Some more time passed by and there was still no sign of Darwin. “Why is he taking so long?” After few more minutes she decided to leave her spot and look for him. When she stepped out of the room she realized that she was all alone in this portion of the building. There was complete isolation and no one to reach to. She started to become anxious and decided to search for Darwin. Few more minutes passed by and she started to panic now. “Where is he? Is he lost? Is he hurt somewhere?” thoughts began to run through her head. She started to run towards the main building and eventually bumped into Darwin who’s off-white shirt was all dirty from dirt and dust. “Where were you? Why did you leave me alone because you got bored?” she started crying as she started pounding his chest. “I am sorry. I couldn’t find you anywhere”, he replied as he tried to calm her down. “Please don’t leave me all alone. It is scary to be alone”, she wailed. They decided to cut short their game time for today after what had happened. On their way back, they saw few kids play out on the hospital ground. Darwin asked Faye to go and speak with them however, she was hesitant to do so. “You need to learn to make friends. Sometimes the first step has to be taken by you”, he said. “But they would make fun of me or not like me”, she responded. “That is ok. It takes time to know someone. Wasn’t that how we met?” he replied to her silly responses. “I will wait and cheer you on from here. You go to that kid over there and just talk to him. It will be fine. You can do it.”, her gave his pep talk to boost her confidence. As Faye walked towards the kid she turned her head to see if Darwin was still within her sight. She reached the kid and started to talk. Few minutes later the kid parted ways and she came back towards Darwin with a huge smile. Her mission was successful. “Wasn’t that easy?” he asked. “I won’t say it was easy but, I think it is a start”, she replied. They both decided to spend the rest of the day on the hospital ground looking at the sky which grew darker. It looked it would rain hence they decided to head back to their room once the there was no more sun rays in sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 5:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the rain pouring outside Faye woke up to a dull day. It looked like that she has to stick to playing indoors today but she had her hopes up in letting Darwin decide on the game for the day. She heard the doors open and found her mom to step in. But along with her she found her doctor to also step in. Her mom sat next to her and started to caress her cheeks while shedding tears. “How are you doing Faye”, the doctor asked. “I am ok I guess”, she replied casually. “That is good. I wanted to let you know that me and your parents have decided to schedule your surgery tomorrow. After tomorrow you will be all better and you will be a regular girl again going to school and having fun with your friends. She paused for a minute and stared at the doctor for a while. She just recalled the reason why she was here, why she had no friends, why her mom always looked so dull. She was sick and this was her ticket to get better. She was scared, but shocked to express it. Her mom had words of encouragement but a lot of things was running though her mind. Her mom and the doctor had step out to the doctor’s room for a while to discuss this further. It was during this time that Darwin entered the room. He wore a clean white shirt and found Faye her spot. He quickly learned about what was going and began to console Faye. She found this action to be repetitive and it had no value what so ever. “You are saying this cause things are going fine for you”, she replied in a harsh tone. Darwin quickly grabbed her hand and took her to the glassed balcony on the floor. “Look over there. That is the same ground where we played yesterday, the same ground where you meet the other kid. It is raining today but it doesn’t mean the ground is bad or gone forever. It is just one day and it will pass. Tomorrow will be a brighter day” he replied. She understand what he meant, it gave her courage something that she didn’t gain from her mom’s conversation. “I have my surgery as well tomorrow and my mom is on her way. I may not see her in time before the surgery. So I need to let her know that I am ok, I can’t reach her over phone so give me an idea to handle this you dummy.”, he said. “A letter maybe”, she replied. “Good thinking you silly. Now I want you to write the letter because my handwriting is not that good”, Darwin demanded. “I didn’t expect much either”, chuckled Faye. As Darwin quoted his words Faye began writing it down. She didn’t give much thought on what was said, but just went ahead and wrote the letter. “That should do it I guess.” he said. “You keep the letter with you cause it looks like your surgery is going to be shorter and since they are going to play with the wires on your head, when I come back for my letter you better remember to hand it over”, he ordered. She smiled to his quirky demands and agreed to it. “I have few tests today and I may not be there to play around but you can try and keep your mom occupied. I am sure she is not as strong as you. Let’s meet up after our surgery and have fun as usual”, he said and parted ways. Faye headed back to her room where her mom was anxiously waiting for her. “Where were you?” she asked. “Nothing much”, she replied. “Mom, it will be alright. Don’t worry”, her short response brought so much assurance that her mom was moved to tears. Faye placed Darwin’s note on the table next to her bed and spent the remaining day with her mom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 6:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nervous about the surgery, Faye woke up really early in the morning. It was still a cloudy day, however the rain had stopped. Her mom was with her the entire time. Faye was going through a lot and really wanted some comfort. The only thing she thought of was the promise she made with Darwin that she would return the letter to him after his and her surgery and they would get to play together again. She wanted things to go right so she could enjoy her life like she has been enjoying for the past few days. She was looking forward to a better future and she has this one big hurdle to jump over. The nurse came and made the arrangement to stroll her on the card to the O.R. She was hoping to see Darwin one last time before she headed to her O.R. however, when she passed by his room, it was already empty. “I guess, his surgery already started. I hope it goes well for him.” she thought to herself as she was being strolled. She reaches her O.R. and she could see the room occupied by many staffs wearing their face mask. Faye heart pounded faster as they prepped her on the table. She was nervous about her surgery, it has been such a long time since she had felt anything in her heart. She had been through a lot of treatment but this time it was different. She wanted for it to go right. She wanted to be alive. She wanted to enjoy life and be with friends who she can play with. Friend like Darwin who make her day bright with their crazy personality, who makes her feel alive. The surgeon took the gas masked and asked Faye to count to 10 backwards. She took her breathe to count down and as she reached closer to one, a drop of tear shed from her eye and she was out for the surgery to begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 7:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faye finally woke up and regained completely consciousness. The sun’s rays were passing through the window and her mother who was seated under the rays was shedding tears of joy as the surgery was successful. “My sweetie, you are back. I am so happy you are still with me.” Faye was happy too, that this will be the last time she has to be stuck in a hospital. She can finally be normal. “How are you feeling Faye?”, the doctor asked. “Ok, I guess” she replied. “That is good to hear. You will have to stay for just few more days to help you get your energy but after that you are free to leave. Most of your charts are clean. Congratulations!”, he replied. Faye and her mom spent the entire day talking and making plans for everything they wanted to after she left the hospital. One thing however did bother Faye, Darwin was yet to visit her. She waited till late evening, however he was still a no show. During the evening checkup, she decide to ask the doctor about him. “Doctor, do you know how Darwin is doing?”, she asked. “I am sorry, who was it again?” “Darwin, he had a surgery yesterday. Is he doing ok?” “I am not sure who you are talking about, but we don’t have a patient called Darwin here. The only child who had a surgery yesterday was you.”, the doctor responded to the curious girl. “Are you sure, he should be in room 408?”, she asked. “That room has been empty for months, Faye”, replied the doctor. Faye’s mom nervously asked the doctor if something was wrong with her daughter. “I am not sure, the condition she had has had cases where people had both auditory/visual hallucinations. Darwin might have been someone from her imagination. In any cases this won’t be there anymore. So you don’t have to worry about that anymore. I will come and see you again tomorrow.” The doctor left the room after the check. Faye quickly recalled about the letter and reached for it. She began to read what was written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It read, “There may never be a right time to say this but no matter what happens, even if I’m not there, you must carry on. Nothing can stop you from moving forward from where you are now. There is far too much to gain, than to lose. So smile, I will always be with you and we will meet again sometime, in a different way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darwin was the last breathe of her faded personality, to give her hope for the future and look for the horizon against all her worries. Faye began to shed tears as she lost her first and true friend. Even though it was all in her head, he was the one closest to her and probably only the friend she ever needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIN.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Across The Street</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With the sun warming up the air and the pleasant breeze blowing by, you get to experience the freshness that spring has to offer. Today, just like any other day I worked at the shop with my manager and colleagues. I may not be a part of a large franchise but I do know that I make my customers happy with what I can offer. My manager is also quite good hearted, he takes good care of us so we make sure we do our part for him as well. Being single, I had less responsibilities. I was in my prime and it was all work for me. You would think that would be a dull life, but it wasn’t. I was content with what I had and did not think much of the future; kind of living with just the present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a huge multiplex construction that was going for quite a while at our neighborhood and today is the day they had their inauguration. The multiplex had taken its effort to make it as visually captivating as possible with the classic lamp poles, flowering Myrtles trees and wooden benches to sit and relax under the shade. This was just opposite to our store, hence I kind of had front row seats for the extravaganza. So many people flocked to the place today. Few bigshot from the town hall, some local celebrities and a crowd of casual visitors and customers. It was a busy and crowded day, but not for us though. I decided to look at the event from time to time from where I could. It wasn’t until I spotted a store which just opened up that actually made me forget everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the myrtles flowers blowing across the store’s glass window I uttered, “Wow”. There she was, the most beautiful person I have ever seen. I knew my heart paused for a few moments. There were celebrities, but then there was her. She was different and I knew something made here shine much brighter than the rest. She was poised, charming and had a class of her own. I got sucked into a weird world that I have never been in and I truly admired her. I was literally gawking at her and I am sure many would have seen this if they had seen my look. I wouldn’t blame them, they would do the same. I knew she was beyond my reach, but I was happy to know that she would be working across the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day, I would wait for our store to open so that I could see her from where I stood, and every day I would see her be even more radiant than before. Her clothing sense were always of class and everyday people used to flock around her. I wish I could too, but I knew I won’t. Our world was the same, but we will always be in opposite lanes. I didn’t mind it though. I was happy from where I stood and what I got to see. This went on for weeks and everyday a new song would buzz me all day. I admired her too much and would always take a chance to sneak a peek from where I was. I am sure my manager would have spotted this, but he would not make a fuss, he knew me well for what I was. Truth be told, I believe I was eager for the next day and the future. I was becoming hopeful day by day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one rainy day, things turned a bit sour though. We had some unwanted customers at our door steps. These were bulky guys who were in no mood to be a part of our store. I was not that built to confront them but their business was with our manager. Once they had stepped out we found out these were henchmen asking us to shift our business to a different locality. I believe a small store such ours is an eye sore when you have such a big multiplex so close. We probably poison their ambiance with our stature. Our manager is strong and is not someone who would bend for such threats. While this did concern me a little, with our manager we knew we wouldn’t have to worry much. Besides, I always had her, in a way. Her presence was enough to turn my frown upside down any day. Unfortunately, fate seems to have had his own plans for me though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, we find our store to be vandalized. No one was hurt or injured, but we were a bit scared for our safety now. We heard our manager faintly say, “They can break my stuff, however they won’t get to kick me out that soon.” We knew we couldn’t abandon him. As we were focusing on getting the store back on its feet, I wanted to see her to ease my mind a little. When I looked across the street, my world started to cave in. She was there as usual, as radiant as an angel could be. But there was someone with her now. He was dashing beyond words and was built to match her radiating beauty. They looked like the poster couple you would see in the movies. Together they shined a lot, but my world was turning dark right now, the vortex only sucked in their light and grew bigger the more I looked at them. She looked happy though, as always. I guess all I could do is be happy for her, after all it was just in my head, nothing was real, Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a couple of days for our store to get completely back on its feet, and my heart also sank in even more despair. It was too heavy to see her with him. I had nothing against him or her, but it was just not the same now. I would keep reminding myself that it was he was the best for her, that she should always have someone who was matched her level, but this was always with a sour taste. My world clouded far too much than ever before and I now had reached a point where I did my best to avoid her. It was not her fault, but rather my own inability to accept my reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day our manager fell ill and we had to be closed for the day. I sulked with my own thoughts that day and it only made my state worse. I knew I couldn’t stop seeing her, but at the same time, I didn’t want to see her as well. It was too complex for me to reason with myself and I had no idea if I wanted to move on, stay or even go back. Next day we found out that a fire had broken in the multiplex and many stores had their merchandises burnt. The store where she worked was where apparently it all started. All that I could think of was her safety. Was she safe? Did she get injured? Is she alright? I realized that no matter how it is was for me, I always cared for her well-being. I regretted the fact that I had no idea who she was, or had even made an effort to know her. Right now I am helpless and useless at this stage with all these concerns for her. Days went by and the store was still shut. I hoped and prayed for her. Just knowing she is safe was all I wanted at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the day came when the store opened up however she was not there. I was depressed and was at the bottom of the pit now. I had no closure for what I was going through and the only one to blame was myself for not taking an effort to go after which made me happy. Not because I wanted her, but to show my gratitude in a way for being a part of my life. I did what I could to function as usual, but a side of me always turned to the store across the street hoping to see her. During lunch hour, our manager had stepped out to get new supplies. He headed to the back alley where he generally parks his car and rode off. On his return he parked upfront and I was speechless during his return. There she was. She was entering our store. The closure I was looking for was right before my eyes, safe and sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hi, I am Vera, sorry I look a little messy. I have seen you across the stores many times but I never could talk to you due to the work rush”, she said with the same smile that she always had. “Hi! I am Zek. Thank god you are safe. You are really beautiful and I have always admired you from here.” He blabbered his thoughts out in nervousness. She started to laugh. “Why, thank you. It will be nice working with you from now on”, she said and that’s all was there to it. We became friends and more importantly, I got to talk to her. The fire burnt her arm a little and the mold of her arm had melted due to that, the store threw her out with the other burnt junk and the manager decided to bring her in as she was still in a very good condition. Yes, she is a mannequin, but so what, so am I. But does it matter how she looks like? She will always be precious to me for how she changed my world, even without her knowing it. And I promise to be by her side as long as I can and will always look forward for our next day. May be that is how fate works for us all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIN.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gulzigheid</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hailing from a noble family makes one’s lifestyle quite exquisite and demand for the best in the world. For someone like me who enjoys food, I expect nothing less than a masterpiece on my plate. I have traveled across seas and kingdoms and have experienced everything that the food world had to offer, or so I thought. It was until a recent trip to a remote town called Vlees that I realized that I haven’t truly relished the joy of food that the world has to offer. I was traveling to a kingdom in Epe with two of my soldiers to attend an annual fest which is considered to be the best in the world. We were passing by a town called Gortel which was a rundown town and since our journey would last a week more we had to stock up from this town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was midday and thus we first headed to the Inn to fill our bellies and then stock up. The served food was revolting and this infuriated me to throw the bowl out the window. My actions caused a stir at the Inn, and I said “What foul meal is this? Do you think you could serve something like this to me? Do you know who I am?!” My ruckus was brought to the attention of the Innkeeper. He came over to apologize and offer a fresh batch of the meal, however I was in no mode to hear excuses. I decided to leave this place and take the food supplies from the market. I could not believe what I was hearing, the vendors pleaded that I took only what is needed. Apparently the town is doing its best to wait for the harvest and they would only ration out small quantities. I ordered my guards to take all the supplies they could carry and use force if required. The commotion caused a lot of verbal hatred being thrown between them and myself. One vendor approached me and said, “Sir, there is a town called Vlees, which is not far from here where you can get more supplies. It is was too expensive for our town to approach them. I am sure they are more than willing to extend their doors for royals such as yourselves.” This calmed me down as the hassle this town has put me through was enough for me to leave it at once.  The vendor directed me the path which was a slight detour from my current destination, however I would be there by sun down. It is odd that I have never heard of this place but at this stage anything would be better than this filth. Hence, we saddled up on our horses and headed to the town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the last rays of the sun hid behind the mountains, we reached the town and we felt that we reached a place that we deserved to be at. Right from the gates of the town, to the Inn where we decided to stay for the night, to the food we ate, everything was something a noble family deserved. Even though the village was small and had only a handful of people, they all looked to be wealthy. Starving due to lack of proper meal during lunch, we had to make up for our losses. The meal served at the Inn was quite exquisite. I have never had such a wonderful meal and the meat tasted beyond this world. “What kind of meat is this?”, I asked. “It is our secret, Sir”, said the Innkeeper. “In our town we take extreme care to nurture our cattle to make it as tender as possible. We sell them to the kingdom nearby, and hence our town is so flourished. The honor of serving the kingdom is all we look for.”, said the keeper with all the pride one could have. “It would be a pleasure to have your meat in our kingdom as well. I would enjoy it more than what the peasants generally make for us”, I said as I recalled the plain food that I got at our kingdom. I even recalled executing some of the cooks for their lack of skills to call them a cook. Once our dinner was done we decided to hit our bed for the night as our senses needed the rest from the intoxicating meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt a bit uncomfortable later that night, I tried to wrestle myself with the bed and for some reason however, I couldn’t. Wondering what was causing this unease feeling I decided to open my eyes and have a look. I was shocked at the sight of my status. I was shackled in chains and found myself lying on the cold damp floor in a very hot cell. I tried to break free of my chains however they were welded tight and firm. I screamed for help and was immediately silenced by the others who were in their cages. Even my soldiers were a part of these cells. As I tried to find the answers for what was going on I heard footsteps approach us. The light seeping through the cracks of the walls gave us a sight of a giant human approach us. “Time to work you slaves!”, said the mammoth as he pull each man from their cells. Trust me, the people in their cells looked really strong, however, they could never over power him even though they tried, even my soldiers were of no match when they confronted him. We headed outside and we were made to work. I have never turned a stone in my life before and here I am now, digging the ground and moving boulders. I threatened the dumb giant to let me go, however he had no interest on a tiny human. With our aching body and huge appetite we headed back to our cells, but before that we were made to wash ourselves, the cold water soothed my skin as the dirt and sweat washed away. With our wash done we moved to our main chamber where the cells were located. While heading to our cells there was something that caught my attention and also made me happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food!! and that too a ton of it. Oh! I felt the gods still haven’t forsaken me. “Eat now, for tomorrow you work”, said the giant with a smirk as he stood a side waiting for us to finish our meal. I ran to the desk and grabbed everything I could devour. I relished every single bite of it. It was a bit under cooked, but at this stage I had nothing to complain as my hunger had blinded my eyes. I ate till I could eat no more, and went and laid in my cell. I was content that the day was over and that I could sleep and rest which my body needed. I was too tired to think of other things at this stage. Next day, I was woken up when a bucket of water was splashed on me. It was cold, so cold. “Time to work you slaves!”, said the giant, proving his vocabulary skills are as small as his head. We went out did our bid, and at the end of day we washed ourselves and went for our meal. Every day, I stuffed myself and the food always tasted great. I understood that the food that you earn tastes great no matter how it is made. This realization made me recall of the hateful comments and words that I said against all the cooks whom I had criticized so much over these years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Days went by and our routine continued. I had started to build quite a fit figure. I wondered if people from my kingdom missed me. If they had ever sent out someone to look for me. If I would ever leave this place. I did also notice that every odd day there would be someone new at the ground and someone we knew had disappeared. I did not give much thought into it, but I did wonder as what might have happened to them. Did they manage to escape, or did they collapse? Few more days went by and one day I decided to try take on the giant with my soldiers. As soon as we were all out of our cells, we jumped on the chance, however he had over powered all of us. Defeat made me wondered if I would ever get to see freedom again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally something happened, not something that I wanted, but I got my freedom. We all headed to the ground for work. As I was moving the rubbles and the boulders I saw another giant walk up to me. “Come with me, you have been summoned”, he said. I was a bit curious as this was something new, but instead of being man handled and taken I decided to go with him. He took me to a kitchen where I saw huge stocks of food being dumped all over the room. “This must be the kitchen from where they get us our meal”, I thought to myself as I walked closer to the cook who was near the oven. Before I could talk, I was grabbed by the giant and thrown onto a chair nearby, tied and gagged till I had no room for movement. I tried to scream “let go of me!”, but my voice was muzzled up with the gag on my mouth. “He is ready”, said the giant signaling the cook. The chef turned around and said, “Oh! Hello, we meet again. How has your stay been? Was the evening food that I prepared any good?”. I was shocked. It was the Innkeeper that I had meet when I came to this town. “What is he doing here? Why is he doing this? What is he going to do to me?”, these through ran through my head. “I know what you are thinking. It is fine, I get this a lot “, he said. “You see, we had recently got an order, and I need to procure the supplies. That is all”, nothing more. I was puzzled and it was visible from my expression. “I guess you do not remember. I told you didn’t I, we take extreme care to nurture our cattle to make it as tender as possible.” I went pale white as I heard this. I knew what was going to happen to me and I was in the most helpless state possible to avoid it. “This might hurt a lot, but it is to make sure the meat is as fresh as possible. Hope you understand this.”, he said as he slowly started cutting pieces of my flesh to have them packed. I screamed and screamed which was silence down my throat as the blade went on with its task. I cried, I prayed, but it would not stop. I wanted this to end, or at least end my own life so that I do not see my own flesh being treated like a meat. Hours went by as I bled to a point where I had no energy left and had bare minimum consciousness. “Oh, it looks like your cell mates would be done for the day. I guess I need to hurry up and cook their meal”, he said as he slit my throat to work on me faster. As I faded into the darkness, I realized that food should be treated as it is meant to be. Nothing more, nothing less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIN&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Platform No.0</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a legend in my town, about a hidden platform at our local underground station. They call it platform No. 0. I have used this train station numerous times but I have never seen that platform before. People say you stumble upon it when the time is right. The myth reveals that anyone who experience a ride in the train that starts from this station would have a life changing experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I myself do not how I reached this platform but I am here now. I was thrilled and anxious at the same time, however I was not scared as I was not alone. I saw a girl, probably 7-9 years old wearing a pink frock stand near the entrance of a compartment which was a couple of blocks away. The compartment doors open and she boarded the train. I was not sure what I should do, however I knew I could not let a kid ride the train alone. So, I boarded compartment closest to me quickly. The doors closed and the train was set in motion. I quickly moved up the compartments to get to that little girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was seated and looking at the window at the one side of the train. I walked up to her and asked her, “Hey there kiddo, what are you doing alone in this train?”. “I don’t know”, she replied. “I didn’t know where to go so I boarded the train. I usually go on a train to meet my daddy. Will this take me to daddy?”, asked the puzzled little girl for whom I did not have an answer. “I’m not sure but I will try to get you to your daddy.”, I said. Her face gleamed with a smile. “My name is Shawn. What is your name?” “Lisa”, she said while looking through the glass window of the train. I turned my head to see what caught her attention and it amused me as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The walls of the underground tunnel were painted with finest detail of images. Images of a child with her mom. That is when I realized, the train is moving at a pace which was not normal. It was slow, as if it was a journey meant to be experienced rather than traveled. The paintings were beautiful, each and every one of them. It told a story of kid laughing and smiling with her parents. Lisa and I moved closer to the window to watch these paintings. It was heart-warming. A painting of the kid smiling with a missing tooth, probably after the fall of the baby tooth. A kid sleeping on top of a big dog as if was the biggest animal in the world. A kid wearing a bug’s costume for Halloween with a bowl full of chocolates and so on. As the train moved on, the kid in the painting grew bigger and bigger with more pleasant memories a kid could have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more we traveled I started to feel cold, quite cold and through of the kid who was by my side ran by my head. May be my care for her had been triggered by these paintings, but none the less I removed my jacket and give it to the girl. “It is getting cold in here, wear this. It will keep you warm”, I said. She smiled at me and said, “Thanks, but I think you would need more than I do”. She was right, I looked to be in a more bad shape when compared to her, but I didn’t expect a kid to be this aware of her surroundings. I slow turned my head back towards the window, when something struck me. The girl in the painting looks like her. I looked at her one more time and this time I was sure. It was her, however I did not know what was happening. Why would the walls be painted by pictures of a girl who was next to me? Who has never been on this train or this route. Before I could ask her about it, the train slowly started coming to a halt and the final painting on the wall was in front of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was shocked at its sight. It was a girl wearing a pink frock at the station with her mom, laughing as usual and the corner of the painting near the track stood someone. It was me who was in the painting and I could see how I looked like. I finally recalled what happened. I had a miserable life, tormented and dreaded as death could be. I never felt happy nor did I feel alive. I was going through the roughest patch of my life and I had no light to set my sights on nor did I have a warmth that I could grab onto. On that day, I was at the station, to end it all and hence waited for the train to come by. A train to stop halt everything in my life. This girl was playing with her mom and had tripped and fell on the track as the train approached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t an act of heroism that I was after, however I felt it was not her time be at this place, hence I jumped and pushed her over to the other side of the track. The train traveled on finally came to z standing halt. “I guess it is time for me to go back to my daddy.”, she said. “Hope you find your station too Shawn”, she said. “You can look at the painting on the other side till you reach your place. Bye! Bye!”, she said.  I turned my head quickly and tears started to flow for what was at sight. I wiped them off and I turned back to bid my farewell with Lisa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally realized that I only have one station to get off, and that would be the last stop, however I was happy she didn’t have to join me till there. I turned around watched the painting on the other side, where all my happy memories of my life passed by. It occurred to me that we do not see what we have and we fixate on the things others have and darken our own world and experiences. I was so absorbed with all the negativity that I missed on being grateful for all the wonderful that I had been through which these paintings are showing me. Now I realized why people say this would be a life changing experience. Getting an opportunity to go through this experience and getting off half through this journey is more than enough to change anyone. Lisa is probably too young to realize this, but I do hope she always cheerful as the painting portrait-ed her. I sat down, relaxed myself as I grew colder and colder to enjoy all my memories I can see as this train headed toward the end of this tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIN.&lt;/p&gt;
