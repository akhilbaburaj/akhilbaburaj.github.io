        <title>The Wooden Case</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“Looks like this is going to be another long night. Leon is not going to be happy about this”, sighed Marge as she got off her car near the still house. The house was already surrounded by yellow tapes as the local police unit controlled people from contaminating the scene. Marge walks up the stairs to the room with Miles, her junior officer and they enter the cold room where lies the body of Ms.Lockhart, a 34 year old, single Caucasian accountant. “Looks like this was a suicide”, says Miles who points to the pills all over the floor. “Did anyone find any note or anything during your search?”, Marge asked openly to the room filled with the first responders who were going through her place. “Nothing for now. The neighbours heard nothing. Based on the initial inquiry they felt nothing abnormal about Ms.Lockhart. Always smiling they say”, answered one. “Any family member we could talk to or report to?”, asked Marge. “Not so far. We plan to check at her workplace for better information”, another one answered. “Fine, if you find anything suspicious please flag it for investigation”, she ordered as she exited the house along with Miles. They both get into the car and Miles drops off Marge at her place before heading home. “It’s 11 P.M. Hope Leon is asleep”. Marge walks up to her son’s room and finds him sleeping. “Sorry I could not get home early as I promised. I will make it up tomorrow”, she whispered to his ear and kisses him good night. She then heads to her room, takes a shower and crashes in for what’s left for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
With the alarm going off at 6 A.M., Marge wakes up and heads to the kitchen. After losing her husband 5 years back she has been a full time unit doing both work and parenting. Also, being in the line of public service and that too with Cops is not an easy task yet, she somehow manages it and tries to not let things wear her down. With Leon and Marge at the dining table having their breakfast of eggs and cereals Marge tries to start a conversation. “I’m sorry for not making to the school play. I was not able to leave work in time due to a last minute thing. I hope you can forgive”. “It’s ok mom, I understand”. “How did the school play go? Did you have fun?” “It was ok, we made a few doozies here and there but everyone liked it.” “That’s wonderful to here. I wish I was there to see you. I will make sure to come next time.” “That’s fine mom. Your work is not easy so I know you do your best.”, said Leon. Marge knew her time with Leon’s life has been slowly been diminishing over the years so the guilt of not being there still remained. “Well! Let’s have a small party tonight. Just you and me. We can order pizza. How does that sound?”, she said. “Great!”, responded Leon. The both got ready and head out the door with a smile to catch upon during the evening. As they walked down the stairs she notices Leon to limp a little. “Honey, what happened? Why are you limping?”. “Nothing mom, I sprained my knee during the play. It should be fine in a day or two”, answered Leon. “Ok, be safe when you do things”, she responded while they both went their own way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“Miles, which locker has the files from yesterday night’s investigation”, asked Marge as she went about looking for the files. “It should be on your desk. Mind you we still don’t have all the pictures and paperwork yet.” She pics up the folder with pictures and paperwork and goes by them. “Nothing looks out of the ordinary. I guess we would have to wait in for the report for the office colleagues to get a better idea about this”. Few hours go by and as she drops the file on the desk to pick up her coffee, she get a call. “Marge here”, she answered. After few minutes she hangs up the phone. “Miles, we got to go.”. They get into the car and head to town to reach 3rd Boulder’s Avenue. The scene is so similar the last one, pretty much every place where Marge visited happen to have the same gloomy atmosphere around it. “Hey, Marge. We have a Male African American in his late 40s. Doesn’t look like there has been anyone else besides him. Not much information from the neighbours. They say he looked fine when they last saw him few days ago downstairs. Looks like he has a daughter who has been married off. But doesn’t look she stays in this town. Based on his wrist look like he did it real deep and probably didn’t feel much after the first few minutes.” Marge walks around the bed to look for any notes and stubbles on a black wooden case kept underneath the bed. She wears her gloves and picks it up. It was old, more like a century old. ‘Must be an heirloom’, she thought. She opens it and finds two carved spaces and one of them had a transparent mask while the other was empty. On the inside of the box there was a metal plate with an engraving… 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;“Wear the one you want but know they wear over time, for your reflection remains till a crystal shatters it when hit by light. - C.S”&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
She looks at her watch and realises it is closing in on her time with Leon. She closes its and leaves it for others to add it to the report. “Miles I am leaving early. Please take over while I am gone”, she said. She reaches home after making a stop at the Pizza place to grab their dinner and finds lights in Leon’s room to be turned on. “Leon, are you home already?”, she asked. “Yea, the lacrosse practice was cancelled today”. “Alright, I have pizza at the table. Come join me after you have freshened up.”. Leon and Marge then had their dinner at the table however, it was awfully quite. Small talks here and there but nothing more. Once they were done, they each headed to their room. At night before hitting the bed, they crossed each other as they switched for the use of the common restroom. While walking across Marge see Leon all pale and drained of life in the mirror, a face that looked awfully similar to Ms.Lockhart. She quickly turn and calls for Leon. “What is it, Mom?”, he asked. She looked at him, paused for a while and the replied, “Nothing, maybe I am just tried from work. Brush your teeth and go back to bed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Next morning, at work Miles walks up to Marge and says, “Nothing from the colleagues, they are pretty much shocked with what happened. Looks like her parents passed away few months back so nothing from that angle either however, you got look at this” as he hands over the remaining files from Ms.Lockhart case. Marge goes through pictures and spots the same case. Again, the transparent remains but the other one missing. “There is one more thing, check the video from the Disk. It is taken from the security camera outside her door.” She quickly play it and find a dark figure, probably a man with sharp eyes wearing a top hat and a large jacket outside her door dropping off the case and then, vanishing into the darkness as he walks away. “This video is barely a week old”, he said. “Miles, we got to find this man. Look at all cases we have and see if we have anything of similar pattern”, she said as she paces to the record room to pull up all the other files. Both Miles and Marge spent the entire day and found few older cases dating across several decades. All having the same black wooden case. Marge gets so absorbed into her work that she drops a message to Leon to inform him to have dinner on his own so she could squeeze in as much as she could before crashing for the night at the precinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Next day, Marge head home to grab a shower before heading to the town to investigate the case. She takes it to a local antique shop to see if she could find the origin of the wood. “Ebony”, he said. “Excuse me!”, said Marge as she felt triggered by his words. “I’m sorry ma’am. I didn’t mean to offend you. The wood is called Ebony because of its rich black colour. That’s a pretty expensive piece of wood that most carpenters don’t usually get to work with. Tough to find within our town for sure. Also, this looks very old. I would say at least a century old.”, said the dealer. “Do you think can find where this might be from?”, asked Marge as she handed it over him. The dealer closely disassembled the box and when he removed the metal plate it had a name, Cornelius Silvester Craftsmanship. Marge thanks the dealer and decided to head back to precinct to look up any available records about this place. As she was heading back, her phone rang. It was the school principal and they had called for her to discuss something about Leon. She heads over to the school and finds out that Leon was caught up in a fight and beat the other kids black and blue. She asked him to apologize  but he wasn’t going to, so she apologized to the parents of the other kid and told she will work with Leon on this. Before heading for work she only stated how disappointed she was with him right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Marge reached the precinct and started to go through all sources to look for anything that matched the name found in the engraving. She kept tracing back all the old cases and finally she did find something, there was a news article that had that name, ‘Cornelius Silvester’. But, this article was old, very old. From 1908 from a town called Stowe, few hundred miles away from Manchester where Marge is currently at. “Miles, I am heading to Stowe now. If you get any more details about the guy from the video then, call me”, she uttered as she rushed outside to the car. She drove for an hour and an half to reach Stowe. She heads straight for the local station to get more details about the person but the sheriff of the town did not know about this. However, he did point out where the property of Silvester was present. She headed over there only to find a partly burned old house next to a disserted workshop. Disappointed while standing at the front of the house she heard a voice “My child, what are you doing out here in the cold?”, an old lady called out for her. “Would know anything about the Silvesters?”, Marge asked. “A little, I do. My mom had talked about them when they were still around. She is no more though. But let’s talk inside sweetie”,said the lady as she welcomed Marge to her house. “My name is Matilda”, introduced the lady. “Now, tell me dear, what are you doing out here this late evening.”, she asked. “I am doing an ongoing investigation and I wanted to know about the whereabouts of the Silvesters.”, replied Marge. “Well my dear, I’m afraid you won’t be able to find them. The last descendent of Silvesters, Mr.Cornelius Silvester is missing and they did not have a next of kin that we know of. But we believe he is no more. Tragic story if you ask me.”, she said. “I don’t get. That should not be true cause we suspect there might be someone still left behind.”, replied Marge. “Well my child, their story goes like this. Mr.Cornelius Silvester was married to Elenor ‘Rose’ Silvester with their son Edgar Silvester and were quite the lovely family of the town. However, one evening when Cornelius was out of town a fire broke out at their place. While Elenor suffered burns across her hands and face, their son did not make it through due to the smoke. Elenor was crushed and hated herself after this. The burnt face only reminded her of the pain of her losing her son. Cornelius made a wooden mask for her, one that resembled her a lot, one that always smiled like she used to. Apparently Elenor wore it always and she became more calm as what reminded her of her pain was masked by it. But, I think deep down it wasn’t the same. Overtime, the mask began to crack and it lost it appeal. Seeing this Cornelius made another mask, one that was more real and would show her face. Something that would allow him to see what she was going through, so she can be more open to him. But, Elenor had other plans. She decided to end her pain when her old mask fell apart. No one knows what happened to Cornelius Silvester. Some people say he left for the woods and killed himself while others say he decided to settle in another town but it would never change the fact that he didn’t know what wife was going thought until it was too late and that guilt would have haunted him till his end.” Marge had a chill run down her spike and it was for the worst reasons possible. She rushed for her car without even giving a proper thank you to Matilda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
She drove her car as fast as she could, skipping red lights and overtaking other vehicles. She headed straight for her house and ran straight to Leon’s room while calling for his name. It was dark, she hit the lights and ransacked the room and found what she did not want to find, the black wooden crate. She scatters around and heads back to the hall only to find the light in the bathroom to be turned on. She walked in slowly towards it and finds her heart to drop dead. “No.. No.. No.. Please, NO!”, she cried. She quickly reached for Leon only to find his pulse to be down. She tries and tries and tries but CPR did not work. “She wanted to know reason but there was only silence she heard”. As she cried next to his body, she sensed someone walking up to the door. “What do you want now! After everything you did!”, she screamed. A hand extended and placed another black wooden case. “What is the point in having this ANYMORE?”, she screamed again. &lt;em&gt;“Masks can be worn by everyone, but not all masks are for meant everyone. So, choose what you want to wear.”&lt;/em&gt;, said the presence as it walked away back into the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All Marge could do was be besides Leon and wail for her sound could never fall on anyone but her own. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
FIN.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Git Commands And Best Practices</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that my work requires me to work with version control it has become curcial for me to improve my game with Git. So I decided to document some of the most common things I expect someone to come across and will be needed to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;clone-a-git-repo&quot;&gt;Clone a Git Repo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As simple as it sounds, you want the content so you clone/download it to your PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone &amp;lt;URL/PATH&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-a-branch-for-the-repo&quot;&gt;Create a Branch for the Repo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we own the repo we can directly make commits to the ‘master’ branch however, it is always good to create a ‘feature’ branch (a clone of the master to edit and work on). This way the working code remains as the same and you test your commits against a clone/duplicate of it. If you mess up you can always be sure that the master copy is not impacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout -b &amp;lt;branch-name&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;delete-a-branch&quot;&gt;Delete a Branch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To delete a local branch you would have use the git branch command with -d or -D(force delete) option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git branch -d &amp;lt;branch-name&amp;gt;
git branch -D &amp;lt;branch-name&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To delete a branch that was pushed(we will discuss about this later) you will use it with the push command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push origin --delete &amp;lt;branch-name&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;switch-between-branches&quot;&gt;Switch between branches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since every branch is its own copy it may require us to switch between them work with different ‘versions’ of the same file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout &amp;lt;existing-branch-name&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; That the -b is not present as -b would go ahead and create a branch if not present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altenately, to switch to the previously ‘checked’ branch you can use ‘-‘ to avoid typing the name of the branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout -
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;commit-on-a-branch&quot;&gt;Commit on a branch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commit means you are saving the changes to your version control system. This process allows you create a track of the changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eg. if you save a file with few contents and commit it. Then, next time you make changes version control will be able to report the new changes. However, lets say you start off fresh and add 10 lines to your file. You save the file (ctrl+s) then, delete the file. You cannot expect version control to remember the file you delete. This is because you had not saved it to version control using commit. Similarly if you change the lines from 10 to 100 and save the file again without doing a commit, you cannot roll to the previous version(10 lines file). This is again because there was no commit done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commit process goes through two stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adding file to staging area (basically let it know you want ‘x’ files to be remembered by version control)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Commit the changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commands:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add .
git commit -m &quot;The message to remember what you did&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;amending-your-commits&quot;&gt;Amending your commits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you were creating a file that had someone’s name on it. You do your add and commit and you are set. But then, you realise that you spelled it incorrectly. So you make changes and do add and commit again. WHile this is fine, your branch now has 2 commits. Assume you are doing some testing so you have to iterate your changes again and again. This leads to a large number of commits into your branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For such testing purposes and changes you can always use ‘amend’ along with your commit command. What it does, is rewrites your previous commit (the most recent) with the new commit.
This way the number of commit results to 1 in the previous example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add .
git commit --amend -m &quot;The message to remember what you did and the changes you just did&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The amend will help you update your local commit history however, if you had performed a git push to the remote branch then, you need to make sure your changes reflect there as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do a generic ‘git push’ the push will fail. This is because the information on your system will not match the one on the remote. Thus you would have to ‘force’ the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push -f origin head
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;update-feature-branch-to-reflect-master-branch-update&quot;&gt;Update feature branch to reflect master branch update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we don’t always get direct access to master branch, and assuming that the master will be updated while you are working on the feature branch you may require to update your local copies to the most latest one present. This involves few series of steps which uses either ‘merge’ or ‘rebase’. You can read more about them on google and youtube however, these are the steps you can perform&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Switching to master branch using checkout&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Fetching latest updates from master&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git fetch -p origin
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Syncing updates of remote master(from online Git repo) to local&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git merge origin/master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Switching back to you last used branch(basically your feature branch)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git checkout -
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Syncing update from local master(downloaded copy) to feature branch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git merge master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will keep adding more commands as I get more time to understand, practice and implement them. So a lot more would eventunally updated here.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Silent Member</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;From the first day till now I remember being here. This house confined to a big land in the outskirts of a tiny village. Very few people lived in this town. Everyone knew each other and functions were always celebrated together cause everyone was family in the end. The house was simple with it’s columns holding the tiled roof. A front patio near a small garden of flowers and trees. A well at the rear of the house filled with water and stretch of trees of various sizes. I remember the day my family moved in. Mom, dad and us 3 kids. Dad used to run the local mill and mom well, mom always did what a mom does, take care of everything. Us kids did whatever we could. I was the shy one though, but that was not the case with my brothers. They would climb the trees and do their monkey business all the time. Years went by and we all grew the way we should and we each had our memories. Scribbling on the walls, marking our height on the pillars, gardening the patio, plucking the fruits off the trees and devouring them when we pleased and many more. There was also a time when I tripped my brother while he was running around. He fell and scrapped his knee so bad that he bled all over the place. It truly was a mistake and I felt so bad about it. But he laughed it off. I tried to be more mature from then on and be the more responsible brother that I should be. Schooling and then college, time flew by so fast but we always stayed together as a family. Vacation time was the best, our relatives would join in and the entire house was full of life. Music, games, chit chat, food and fun. Everyone had their own gang and it was truly one the most fondest memory of life. But with all occasion comes the time for farewell and the time when my heart would go empty. I didn’t mind it though. Experiences are everything in the end. 
&lt;br /&gt;
Over the years my brothers had gotten great jobs and left this town to pursue bigger dreams. I was so proud of them but they couldn’t take Mom and Dad with them. I decided to stay behind and be there for them. When my brothers returned we had some shocking news though. Both of them seems to have married off to a girl from another town and did not utter a peep for months . Mom and dad were furious. I didn’t see a problem but I felt bad that we were not part of their hour of happiness. After hours of fight they finally reconciled. To make it officially known we decided to host a function and invite everyone to our house. The house was filled with colorful lights and sound system. Everyone in town was there to enjoy the occasion, it’s been so many years but I can recall everything that happened that day. It was truly and unforgettable day of my life. But as time flew by things changed. People change. Mom and dad were very weak and I did what I could but that was not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bad-ending&quot;&gt;Bad Ending&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brothers changed for the worse. I don’t know if it was them or because of their wife but it was all money they thought of now. May be the world outside this town is like that. They would fight constantly on who got what and it reached the pinnacle when it hurt mom and dad more emotionally than the physical toll of their age. The finally decided to forge the will and soon after; both my parents passed away, one after the other in a matter of weeks. It was a rainy time and the rain hid my tears well. With both of them gone and both the brothers coming to an agreement they decided to tear down the house and me and then, sell off the land. It’s fine. I’m just a house in the end. I won’t bleed nor can I scream. It’s all just property and my worth matters only as long as you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;good-ending&quot;&gt;Good Ending&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brothers flew in and they knew it that their parent’s clock would eventually stop. The will was written, mom and dad knew how much the house was part of the family and wanted my brothers to make sure they kept it as it. I stood along with them during their last breathe and it was time to say good bye. My brothers would leave me behind from time to time but that’s fine I’m a house after all. But I know they would return with their family and my nephew’s. I will wait here strong. I may damage overtime but I won’t die. I will be a part of this family till the day they won’t need me but that’s fine. Wasn’t that my mom and dad built me in the first place, to be the home that her kids could return to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

        <title>Beyond Faces</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“It’s Seven P.M. Time I wrapped my work and head home”, said Amaya as she sorted out the papers on her desk and stacked them in their file. She looks around and finds no one in office. Pretty usual sight as people usually leave by four or five in the evening. It is not that Amaya is bad at her work, it’s that people tend to rely on her a lot when they can’t get something done on time. Truth be told, it is more of people taking advantage of her. Amaya works hard and really does her job good but, she is not the type to stand out. An average girl to look at and talk to as well. There isn’t anything ‘fun’ she would bring to the table. She does gardening however, I don’t think that is what people wanted to hear. She walked to the elevator, and headed out of office. While taking the metro to reach home she over heard a couple girls talking to each other. They were talking about a new Dating App and how great it is. Amaya did not have boyfriend and she knows that it’s her fault for not trying her best. She wore little to no make-up, she wore plain clothes and her enthusiasm level in a group was fairly low. “It would be nice to know on how to engage in a conversation with people”, she thought. She lied on her bed and she installed the App on her phone, but after pausing for a few minutes she refrained from creating an account. “This is silly. Don’t fall to such level now Amaya.”, she said to herself. She kept the phone on the side stand and went to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next day in office during her break to the pantry she bumped into a group of her team members. They were all talking about their recent dinner dates. She tried to dodge the conversion and moved up closer to the coffee machine. “Hey! Amaya, what about you? How is your boyfriend?”, asked a colleague. “Umm.. I don’t have one right now”, Amaya replied. “Oh? How about your previous..”, the others abruptly stopped him from asking further. There was an awkward silence around the pantry room and she headed back to her desk in embarrassment. That night Amaya decided to create her account however, when it came to the point of putting the name and picture she started to hesitate. She decided to go through it and created her profile. However, this was not a regular profile. She kept her name as Bellossom after the Pokemon she adored and used the cartoon picture as a profile. Here exceptions weren’t much but she figured someone might have a similar liking. She was taken to a section called ‘people near by’ and while she scrolled through the list she was hit up with a direct message. “Hi”, it read. She was anxious as this was the first time she is interacting to a complete stranger. Before she could respond she got the next message. “I’m in town for the week. Want to hook up?”. She fell shallow for the kind of message she got. She immediately blocked him off. Few minutes pass by and she gets another one, then another. It looks like all she attracted were creeps. She felt depressed seeing how the only these kind of people reached out to her. She was about to remove the App and forget this experiment when, she found one profile, Quasimodo. This was a cartoon character she know about from Disney’s The Hunchback of Notre Dame movie. She had a small smile on my face when she saw there was profile as similar as hers. She sent out a message, “Hi. Didn’t Quasimodo already have Esmeralda? Didn’t know Quasimodo was so bold to double date.”, hoping it would be a good start. Few minutes past by, but no reply. ‘Guess the account is not used anymore, she thought. She kept her phone on the night stand and went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wakes up the next day and finds a response in the App while she doing morning ordeal. “Hahahaha! I didn’t know Pokemon were on the App either. But I guess you are referring to the Quasimodo from Disney’s movie. The true story is much darker though. If you don’t mind having your world turned upside down then, I will recommend you try Victor Hugo’s novel. It is a pretty good read.” Curiosity got the better of Amaya and she did a quick search online and found that it indeed was true. On route to work she stopped by the local library and picked up the copy. She read the novel and was immediately hooked on to it. She kept reading even at work and was nearly done by end of the day. What he said was indeed true, the story would flip anyone’s world if they thought the movie was genuine. Let alone Disney’s version. “I actually looked up what you said and borrowed the book. Wow, it’s such a dark and tragic story. Much different than what the movie had shown.”, Amaya replied. “Glad you liked it. Not all movies capture the true story as it written.”, came the response. “Indeed. So Quasimodo, are you looking for your Esmeralda here?”, texted Amaya. “Hahaha. May be yes, may be not. Just trying something out. How about you? Didn’t expect a Pokemon to be on an Dating App. Are all the other pokemon’s caught by the trainers.”. Amaya chuckled at his response. It wasn’t a great joke but someone was playing along rather than be blunt about their intension to get into ones pants. Amaya continued texting him all night. A casual, silly talk where both just wanted to have a decent conversation without a goal. They ended their conversation for the night and bid to catch up again tomorrow. She hit her bed with a smile on her face and cozzed her under her blanket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the weeks passed by she texted him a lot more frequently. She works just like she always did however, during her breaks she used to text and so would he. Neither of them have told who they really are and kept their identity confined however, both enjoyed the other’s company. Even if it was just messages over a phone. He was an avid reader and a cook. He has read a ton of books and owns quite a collections. He would recommend novels and Amaya would give it a try. Amaya too let her passion for gardening be know. He was encouraging and stirred up the conversation to know her likes. They would share picture of what they cooked or what they read or what plants they saw. Both enjoyed what they had and their picture collection grew over the weeks. Lines of texts, shapes of leaves, flowers from plants, food on plates and many more. Amaya was seen to be more happy at work and people could see this. Occasionally colleagues would ask what was going on but the idea of sharing to them held her back. She felt bad that she was still not much different on the outside. That night while she talked with him things went a bit awkward for her. “Hey, if it is ok with you, Would you like to grab a cup of coffee at a book cafe located near River St.?” was the text she had got. Amaya was nervous. She didn’t want to ruin how things are between then however, she did not feel confident about herself to meet him yet. She didn’t want to say ‘Yes’ yet but she didn’t have a right reason to tell him ‘No’ either. “I think I will pass. It is not that I don’t want to meet you but I am not comfortable yet to meet you in person. I really hope you would understand.”, she wrote her words down but hesitated to hit send. She took awhile bouncing her mind and heart around and after few minutes, after taking a deep breathe, she hit send. “…”, she saw him type his response and she anxiously waiting for the words to pop-up. She was completely glued to her screen. “Ok. I understand. May be another time I guess. If you do know of a place you want to meet sometime later, I’m, ok with that too.” , his response made her so happy but she felt bad for missing out a chance in known him better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few days later during their usual nightly conversations Amaya was brought with one the most oddest ideas she has heard in her life. “Hey, what are your plans for this weekend?”, he asked. “Nothing much. Probably read one of the books you mentioned few days back, why?”, she replied. “Well, I was thinking if we could meet this weekend.”, he said. Amaya felt uncomfortable to say No, however she still felt she was not ready yet. “I know you said you were not comfortable and I guess it is still the same. But I would like to try something out. It is new and probably that I myself would not have done one on my own but I guess it will work out for both of us”, he stated. Amaya felt happy to know he still is considerate about her but she was curious to know what he had planned out. “What do you have in mind?”, she asked. “So, there is a comic-con this weekend at the sports dome. Just to give you an idea, you can dress up as anyone you want and attend it. If you are up for it, we could meet up but all costumed up. I know it sounds silly but, would you want to try it out?”. Amaya was confused with idea but as hysterical and embarrassing as it sounds she felt it could work. “Are you sure? I would feel really embarrassed to go to such a place all dressed up?”, she added. “I know but, the fun part is that we are allowed to be dressed up. So we probably are not gonna stand out much.”, he said. After taking few minutes and running the idea down her head she decided to say ‘Yes’. She knew she could say ‘No’ however, she didn’t want to push him off again. She really did want to know him better and this might be the best chance for her. They both agreed to meet up near the entrance with their costumes. Amaya went to bed wondering how this would go about. She was anxious to meet him and at the same time felt embarrassed about what she is about to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the day of comic-con and there was a lot of people at the dome. Amaya truly was new to the place and she was too embarrassed to be too visible. So she wore very casual clothes and a hoodie. She had a Guy Fawkes mask that she had from last Halloween. She anxiously waited at the entrance, the place where they both decide to meet up. They planned to meet up and then shared the costume details. Few minutes pass by and Amaya was already amused by the shear number of people attending the comic-con and the costume they had. It was a colorful venue with a lot of happy faces around. While she was looking around she gets a text, “I’m here. Wearing a white-shirt and carrying a duffel”. She quickly looks around and spots him. “Found you! I’m walking towards you. I am wearing a hoodie”, she replied. He starts to look around and as she approached from behind, he turned around. Amaya was shocked with his costume. He wore a horse mask wearing glasses. It was the most silliest thing she has seen till date and she burst out in laughter. “Bellossom? Is that you?”, he asked. “Yes!”, she replied laughing. “Good to know you are enjoying what I am wearing. I didn’t know what to wear even through I proposed the idea. So I picked up the first think I could wear. What are you supposed to be?”, he asked. “Honestly, I would call this Annoymous on vacation”, Amaya replied and they both chuckled for a while. “One of my friend’s recently had traveled to Japan. Since you enjoy gardening I though of getting something for you.”, he pulled out a packet of seeds and gave it to her. “It’s supposed to something called as ‘Bonsai Tree’, tree in a pot. Not sure if you would know.”, he said. “Yes, I know. Thank you so much!. I’m so sorry I came empty handed. Where are my manners”, Amaya frantically responded. “That’s fine. I’m kinda intrigued to see how they grow, let me know how they do”, he replied giving a thumbs up as the mask clearly covered his facial expression. After that they went to watch the comic-con exhibition. They both talked a lot about their personal experiences, the music they listened to, the places they have been to, all but their name and what they did for work. They roamed the exhibition and took lot of pictures with each other and with others people with their costumes. A lot of photo-boming and may fun moments. During lunch they both eat with their mask on. Both looked ridiculous when doing so and laugh at each other but, they were fine with it. The day ended and Amaya felt a lot closer to him but there still a fear in her when he asked if she wants both to remove the mask now. That night Amaya realized that next time she will not mess-up and will take the next step. Not because she felt she was ready but because she knew that he would understand her situation as long as she is honest with him and truly was someone to get connected to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Days passed and Amaya’s confidence grew just like the planted tree seeds, they still continued using their fake alias but it had reached a point that it did not matter much. They both grew close to each other and faces were the last thing they worried about it. She would send him pictures of the plant almost every day to show how it grew. There was an upcoming weekend late night fair at the beach and he had invited her to join in. He had mentioned there will be a lot of fairs around the beach and if she was still worried about showing here face then, they could still buy a mask and walk around the beach. Amaya liked the idea and was more confident in meeting him this time. She had dressed up for the occassion however, still had a mask on. She waited for him near the cotton candy machine and they, both decided to take a stroll down the fairs. They both played various games, sat in the Ferris whell and walked down the beach. Some distance further down the beach where there was no one, they both decide to lie down on the sand and look at the sky. They let the sea breeze and the clear sky captivate their night. “Hey, tell me something. Why did you name yourself Quasimodo?”, Amaya asked. “You don’t look like him. I have not seen your face but you certainly do not have a hunchback”, she added. “Well Quasimodo was a happy go luckly guy yet the world branded him for what he looked like not for what he was. I want people to know me for what I am and not for how I look”, he said. Amaya understood his words more than anyone would. “What about you? Why the hiding?”, he said. “I guess I am like you. But, I don’t have much to offer. Faces and words can be deceiving but actions won’t. I rather would want people to know me for what I do than, anything else.” she replied. “So when do you think these masks are not needed between us?”, he asked. “Eventually”, Amaya replied. They both spent time on the beach trying to enjoy what the world had to offer before they both headed off for their homes. Amaya felt happy about how close they have become and truly for rooting for things to go well from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, while taking the metro one day Amaya found that there was a Halloween themed party at a nearby disco joint this Thursday. She quickly texted him hoping to see if he would like to join her and in few minutes she got a confirmation. She decided to show herself to Quasimodo after the party and hoped she could be more open with him. She marked her calendar and went about anxiously waiting for the day in excitement. At home she looked for the best clothes she could wear and went through her wardrobe multiple times. She tried on my many clothes but none made her feel pretty. But she didn’t give up, she left home to the local clothing store and started to look for clothes. She really wanted to make this work and put in all the effort she had. Finally it was the day of the party. Amaya looked at the clock every passing moment for it to struck five so she could leave for the day and meet up with him. “Hey Amaya, how is it going? Can please help in finishing this document by today evening. It is urgent and I won’t be able to do this today. Pretty please?”, said one of her colleagues trying to pursue her to dump off her work. “But this will take the entire night. I kind of have plans today.”, Amaya replied. “Seriously! I ask for your help one time and you are not even considering my situation. I wouldn’t ask you if I couldn’t absolutely avoid this.”, replied her colleague trying to guilt trip Amaya into taking the work. Amaya felt bad that she was not helping her colleague out but this is the first time she had made plans of her own and she didn’t want to step back out of it. “Hey Stephnie, Amaya seems to have plans. Why don’t you reach someone else. I’m sure there are others who might help you out.”, came a voice from behind. Amaya turned around and found Barak walking closer to her desk. Barak is a good looking, fit, smart and overall a genuinely nice person to be around. Amaya barely talked with him other than work as he is an extremely social person around the office and she found it tough to be around with such people. If only her confidence was good as his. “Hey, overheard you have made plans for today. That’s the first time I heard you talk about something other than office work. I guess the rumors about your being very different is true.”, he smiled and wished her luck for the night as he walked away. The day had ended and she headed to powder room to change and head for the venue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amaya was at the party and waited for him to arrive. It was 10 minutes past their meet time and still no show. She grew anxious but she had trust in him. 20 mins and still no show. She tried texting him but there was no reply. She didn’t know if he was ok or if she is being stood up. Amaya felt her confidence starting to crack. 40 minutes and she was about to be in tears. She convinced herself it her fault to trust in people and that things would be any different. As she was about to head out the door opened and in-came someone panting. It was kind of dark to figure out who it was but he had a bag with a glow in the dark keychain. Kinda similar to the ones both of them got at the comic-con. “Quasimodo, is that you?”, she asked. “Bellossom, is that you? I’m so sorry for being late. I got mugged on the way from the station and had to go the police. I had no ways to reach you.”, he replied as he was catching his breathe. Amaya felt happy that he was safe and she guide him to the table where the drinks were served. She picked up a glass and turned to give it him and she had the shock of her life. The guy panting was Barak. Of all the people in the world, the one person she felt too far to reach was just an arm’s reach away. The same person she had been so constantly in touch was the same person she stayed away from at office. The confidence she had mustered blew up and she had nothing to keep her cool. “I’m sorry I have something urgent to do, I have to go now.”, said  Amaya and started to run away. “Hey! Wait”, he shouted as he tried catch up to her but she was long gone. Amaya was completely confused. As much as she wanted to know the person this ended up being someone from office and someone who she felt was light years away from her reach. “This is not how it is supposed to be. I will be ridiculed for being around him. I don’t deserve someone like him.” such words floated around her head. The reality that Barak was the one she wanted to date will be more painful to bare when it shatters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Couple of days passed by and Barak had his phone with him again. He texted her however, she did not reply. Even at office she would stay away from him. He would text her asking if things were ok and if there was something he did but she never responded. Few days passed by and Amaya stated to hit a state of depression, her lack of confidence to handle this situation and also seeing Barak being hurt in the process was too much for her to handle. She decided to end it once and for all and decide to reply to Barak. “You don’t look like Quasimodo. You are far too good looking to play his role. Pretty sure you already have a girlfriend if not many. It was nice to know you but I don’t want to be played around. Bye”, text Amaya trying to enrage him and drop off their chats. Barak tried to reason with her but it wasn’t helpful. She would just try to be as harsh as she could be but he wouldn’t back off. She decided to remove the app for good and un-installed it. Trying her best she would keep a fake smiley in office just to have the days pass by but deep inside she needed a change. To her luck and thanks to her tremendous results with her work, their office was opening a branch in another city and they wanted her there to get things moving. As wonderful as the opportunity is she was not sure if she wanted to leave things as it is or wrap it up before going. She took a day to think about it and said yes to the offer. The news spread throughout the office about her new job and everyone were happy. Even Barak, even if he was having his own problems. They wanted Amaya to move in 5 days hence, she was busy in sorting her travel and luggage and this helped her forget his problems for a while. Amaya would still wondered if she was doing the right thing. Leaving thing half way. She decided to install the App again and text Barak one last time. “Hey, I don’t know if you are still there but I wanted to apologize for everything I did or said. I will be leaving town soon so I wanted to apologize to you in person if possible. Let me know if you are still there”. “Ok. If that’s how it is then, fine. We can meet up one last time.” he replied. They decided to have a dinner at a themed restaurant on the day before she had her flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last day of the office and farewell party for Amaya to remember. Just before Amaya left for office she was able to see the Bonsai tree bloom with flowers. It reminded her of many things between her and Barak. She had finally made up her mind on what she wanted to do. Food, drinks and music during lunch was the agenda. It was a wonderful party for everything to remember. She was way more outgoing than usual. She would go and greet people and take pictures with everyone. She looked at Barak and found that he had eyes on his watch every few minutes. He was more anxious about his dinner than what was going around. She quickly drops of a message to Barak stating that the theme for the restaurant doesn’t involve masks and this time it will be face to face. Barak read the message and had a sense of happiness overflow through him. She quietly walks us to him and says, “Hey Barak, what are you doing? Join me for a photo. I might not get someone as helpful as you around there.”. Barak shook his head and smiled for the camera as she took her selfie with him. The day was about to end however, Amaya had some last minute work to sort out before she could leave. She asked for Barak to help and as much as he wanted to leave early he decided to stay back to help her out. It was Six P.M. and it was time for him to leave, luckily all work was wrapped up. Being the only two remaining they decided to walk towards the elevator one last time. As they entered the elevator Barak’s phone buzzes with a notification. It was a message from Bellossom, “I am sorry it took so long for me to confront my emotions. I am sorry I made you wait out for so long just to see me leave. I am not sure if I am still good enough for you. But, I do hope I can make you smile just like you are this picture with me.” The message was followed by picture attachment, A selfie of both of them from today. Barak looks up at Amaya. “So Quasimodo I hope you are still up for the dinner with someone like me?”, she said. The elevator door slowly closed but anyone outside would have got to see Barak smile at Amaya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIN.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>White Shadow</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I lay on my bed trying to fall asleep however, it looks like this will take time. “I should not have had that much of caffine this late at night. Looks like I am going to have a terrible morning”, I said to myself. I got off my bed and walk towards my balcony where there is a hint of moon light. With a mild breeze blowing by here I stand at my apartment balcony 6 stories high, looking out into the city. A big flat here out in the states with exotic decor and fine art around. It nice to be an independent women working at the higher ranks of a corporate office. I turn myself and my head towards the floor and I see the shadow my body makes with the light the moon has to offer. You see shadows when there is light however, I remember seeing a white shadow once during the early days of my life. One that haunted me everywhere I went. One that was even visible in pitch darkness. One that made we fear everything around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was few years back I suppose, I just moved to the city to work. From a small town with people you know being just around the corner of the road. But the city was big and roads stretched for miles. People from near and far you would see, someone new everytime on the same street. I had just joined my company right after my community college and that too away from home. I was learning to stand on my own feet, it was me against the big world. I had moved into a place near by the office to avoid the hassle of travel. Learning the ways of my works was like catching the bullet train with a small hook. It would start at dawn and end at night. All I could do was catch up and wait for the weekend so that I could hit my bed before the next week started. Luckily I had few familiar people in the city like my housemate, Emma and few of my college contacts. I would be dead tired and a weekend on my bed looked to be more soothing however, I would head out once in a while. Not because I wanted to but because I would be dragged around by the circle of people I knew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one Friday night we all headed out to a local food joint. Random classic hits and dimmed light, the restaurant tried its best to please it crowd however, it was too mundane like the rest I have been to. I always saw my circle talk about their insane week and their insane job and here I am waiting to hit my bed once this meetup was done. While these guys talked someone approached our table. “I think I have seen him before”, I thought to myself. It was another chap from my college. I would have probably met him like few times. People recognized him and he joined in with us, the whole gang then continued with their chatter. “How are you doing, Grace?”, he asked. “Wait, how does he know my name?”. “You probably don’t remember but we had few classes together. I’m Adam”, he said. Apparently he had just moved to the city a week ago. My energy levl was low so I tried to meet the necessary meet n’ greet and headed home to catch on my zzes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new week was in dawn and I was back on my usual schedule, running to office and back home. One day while returning home I found my housemate outside our place talking to someone. As I walked closer I got a glimpse of the person. It was that guy from the restaurant. “Hey! Good Evening.”, he said. “Hey Grace, guess who’s is now our street mate”, Emma said. “His office was nearby and he too was looking for a place. We have been place hunting on craigslist and finally we got one. That too just opposite to our place”, Emma was cheerful as now there is someone she can spend time with when she returns home early. “When did you two get so close”, I asked. “Oh I have been in touch with him on Facebook ever since he moved here. That’s how he joined us during last weekend. I told him we were all there. I thought I told you this”. It made sense now but I was too tired to be excited for you. “I hope we get along better”, he said. “Sure. Of course”, I said as I smiled with the few ounce of energy I had and walked into my house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now every evening when I returned, I would see these two out talking on the street. They would invite me over for a talk and I tried avoiding it as I was exhausted from work. However, after few days I started to join them after a quick wash to freshen up. They would walk up and down the street where we had few trees and a row of street lights. It was just a casual set of talks and all I did was walk. I had no interest in sharing my life draining office story. I would prefer to lay on my bed and wait for the next day to start. “You know, you shouldn’t lay on your bed once you are back from work. Try going for a walk. It would help you sleep better.”, he said. “Wait, how does he know what I do once I come back from office. Am I that readable?”, I thought to myself. That’s fine I don’t do it always, I said. As we made a final turn before heading home a gentle breeze had brushed off all the trees and us. “Is that lavender I smell”, he said. “Lavender’s are always better than roses. Do you girls also feel the same?”, he said took deep breathe. Asides from the creepy fact that he just sniff out my body wash’s flavor he also seems to know what it was. It’s odd, I just changed the flavor just yesterday. Clearly he shouldn’t be able to guess it out. May be I am just over thinking. “It doesn’t matter which was better, in any case they both are great flowers”, I said as I wrapped up my walk and headed home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Office work grew a bit softer now. May it is because I am starting to get a hang of this. Also, I was able to meet some pecuilar people in office, interesting ones I must say. For unknown reason I started to jelly quite well with them and now I was part of a pack of 3 people. Truth be told I may call it an achievement based on how I unsually am among my peers. We have a small group in our Facebook messengers and we would crack a lot of silly jokes. It was addictive. I had the habit of texting these guys while I had that evening walk. I would be glued to my screen more instead of interacting with the other two walking with me. “Hey, instead of messaging Blake and Ruby you should look where you are going”, he said. “Hey, don’t you know it not nice to look into other people’s phone.”, I stated. “I just wanted to know what tickled your funny bone. I didn’t mean to intrude.”, Adam said as he apologized for his behavior. I decided to cut short my walk and headed back for the night. As days went by I skipped the evening walk as I was getting more comformtable just texting these two folks. However, Adam started to slowly text me. If only my housemate hadn’t given my number to him that day. Since we cross paths on every other day I would usually drop off one word responses. However, his texts were always creepy. He would ask me if I had my toast and eggs in the morning. He would ask me to wake up early instead of running to office at near office hours. He would ask me to sit up straight and not curl up while I watched netflix. Asked me if I had read my book in the night before I slept. It was weird that he knew my habits so well. When, I asked him how he knows he would say my flatmate said it out when he talked with her during the evening walks. I am not sure if it were true however, she did have the tendency to be an open mouth. It was my mistake to take these things lightly as things started to become a bit too intense soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blake and I kind of started having some kind of chemistry. I didn’t want to rush into it like an idiot but I did feel cupid did float around me. I started to text him a lot privately over SMS and called him too. I didn’t know if he felt the same however, I hoped we were on the same boat. One evening my flatmate called Adam over for movie night. I was not interested however, she dragged me into it as well. I was engrossed in texting Blake and gave very little presence to the people around. “Grace could you stop texting Blake for sometime and try enjoying the movie with us. You two have your date tomorrow right, nothing to sweat about it today”. Adam’s comment swept a shock down my spine. “How did he know I was texting Blake? How did he know we have plans for tomorrow?”, these thoughts ran though my head as I was both angry and scared at the same time with Adam. “How do you know this?”, I exclaimed. “I am friends with Blake too”, I talk a lot with him. We go to same sports arena. Has he not told you this yet?”, Adam said. I immediately checked Blake’s friends list and he was right. I texted Blake asking him about knowing Adam and he said yes. I didn’t know why would Blake hide this nor why Adam know such details. I was worried a bit of my privacy now as Adam knew things and he was the last person that I wanted to know about me. I wanted to tell Blake not to share stuff however, I didn’t want him to think I was a control freak. I decided to let it slide however, I was not happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week passed, me and Blake had plans to watch a movie. It was a comedy movie and the review was bad. Blake let me be in charge of the day plan and I purposefully booked a crappy movie so we would have less people around in the theater so could get a bit more cozy. The movie started and as we got comfortable I got a call. I picked up my phone and checked, it was Adam. I felt annoyed and kept it back. Once the call ended, he dialed again, and again. I got furious and just switched off my phone. Few minutes later Blake got a call. “Don’t pick up his call” I said but, Blake insisted that he picked up. He answered the phone and then, quickly grabbed my hand and we both went out. I was puzzled with his actions. “Emma is hurt and hospitalized”, he said. We both rushed to hospital to see her. Adam stood there and had a rage on his face. I went to check on Emma and avoided him as much as I could. She was unconsious. “She tripped and fell while he was moving things around”, Adam said. “Stop being so obsessed with your own life and answer people’s phone when they call. You are too naive to quickly judge people and their character. For once try to care about others too.”, Adam words were harsh and pricked my consciousness. Adam offered to stay beind and watch over Emma while Blake decided to drop me off home. “May be I am just paranoid with Adam. He might be just a bit too close to people around him.”, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Blake dropped me off, he headed to his house. I thought he would give me company however, looks like it did not strike him then. In the end I had a miserable night that day. I couldn’t sleep and to add on it I felt someone breathing down my neck. After being restless for hours I woke up. It was 3am in the morning. I looked around my room cause I felt something was off however, I didn’t find anything. I walked out of my room and down the hall. I found Emma’s phone. I unlocked it with her childish security lock of 1290 which was nothing more than her date of birth which she used for most things. I looked at her notifications and I found a lot of messages, messages from Blake. Wait, Blake told he hated texting on facebook. Even when the group started he had would only join in during the night from his laptop. But he has been texting Emma all the time. Flirting as well. I didn’t know what was going on. I headed back to my room to try and sleep of my confusion for now. May be I will check on this tomorrow. I layed on my bed however, I fell a glare of eyes on me constantly. Eyes that could pierce through my blanket and dead at me. With no sleep seen for minutes I had taken my pillow and headed to the hall where I slept on my couch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next day at work I decided to check into Blake’s laptop when he was not around. I quickly opened his Facebook messenger and there wasn’t a single chat history with Emma. “Wait does it mean he talks to her and delete it after that?”. I then found his texts with Adam. It looked like Blake did talk to Adam a lot however, nothing out of the ordinary. However, there was one small set of interactions though. Talking about looking at unsecure CCTV camera. Blake seems to know quite a bit on how to take access of these camera. Looks like Adam found a link about it and Blake knew about it long before. Blake even talked on how there are ways to view webcams as well and how he had done that in college with few of his mates. I started to doubt if I really knew Blake well. First the deleted chats with Emma, now talks about snooping in on webcams. Is he trustable?, I thought. I quickly closed of his tabs and then, deleted the history before I returned back to my place. In the evening I went to visit Emma however, she was still unconsious. We had called her parents and they have decided to take her home to help her recover. I helped them pack her stuff from her room and while doing so I found a shirt that looked like Blake which he worn on our first date. Blake has never been inside our house. Even on that day when he dropped me off. How is his shirt here?, I thought. I hid the shirt and helped Emma’s parents collect here stuff and leave for the night. Now I was in this big apartment, alone with my thoughts that worried about my own safety. I decided to take a shower and then, probably hit the bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once my shower was done I went to my bed. I closed my eyes yet I had too many thoughts for which answers were not there. The feeling of glaring eyes was still there and it was haunting me as well. I felt unsafe in my own house. Few minutes later, the stress was killing me and I was out of my mind. I decided to head home and probably call in sick for the week. I started to packet my stuff and dashed for my door. As I opened the door I found Blake outside. “Hey, I wanted to check in on you. I heard Emma’s parents came by to collect her things. Are you ok?”, he asked. I was not sure whom to trust or what to do. “I am not feeling right. I am going home”, I told and tried to walk past him. He caught my arm trying to calm me down however, fear was the only thing I felt. While stuggling to let him go of my arm, I dropped my bag and also made him go off balance and fall too. I quickly collected my things and just fled the place without helping him. “Blake is probably mad at me right now. I should have at least apologized”, I thought yet I was still walking to the closest bus stop. My natural instincts was asking me to leave this things behind for now. I quickly boarded the first bus that took me to my hometown and left for home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached my home and my parents were surprised that I was here at this hour. I told them I got home sick. I didn’t want them to worry about what was happening. I went to my room and started to unpack. While unpacking I found another phone in my bag. “Wait this belongs Blake. Did I end up grabbing this as well”, I thought to myself. I just landed on my bed with a half unpacked bag on the side. As I tried to close my eyes. I got a message on my phone. “Hey, you went home? What happened? Are you ok?”, it was Adam. “How did he know? There is no ways for him to know this.” I texted him back asking how he knew where I was to which he replied Blake called me just sometime back as he was worried about you. “Which number?”, I followed up. “His cellular number, he has only one phone. Don’t you know that.”, he replied. I quickly flipped opened Blake’s phone and made a call to Adam. Hello, he said. “It’s me, Grace!”, I exclaimed. “Now tell me how you got to know I am at my home when Blake’s phone has been with me the whole time!”, I was furious as I raised my questions. I wanted to stop this game once and for all. “Grace, you should not sleep on your bed in such an awkward position you know. It is not good for your spine”. I was shocked. How???. I slowly got up off my bed as I started to look around my room. “Blake is not good for you. You deserve someone better. Someone who would appriciate you for what you are. For looking pretty even in your blue PJs. I see you for what your are. I always watch over you, Grace”, he said. I slowly turned and looked at my desk. I had a desktop in my room on which I had a webcam. I moved the phone closer to my chest as I walked to it. The PC was locked then, how?. I turned Blake’s phone speaker ON and placed it on my desk. “Grace, I have always admired you every since I met you for the first time. You shined so bright that it was so hard for me to even come close to you. Then, I got a chance to be with you in one of our classes however, the other guys always hovered over you. Those guys never deserved you. I knew you would not fall for their tricks and I was right. You were always so pure. But then, you moved to the city and left me behind. It took a while to track you down. It was nice that Emma had the tendancy to post eveything on Facebook. It was easy to track you from there on. I managed to move to city and kept in touch with her. I got her help to find a place close by so we could be close again. You remember our evening walks. They were so wonderful but then, you slowly started to mingle with Blake. He is not right for you. I know so many things about him that you would never know. Things that he would never share. I tried to make sure you would spend time with me and me alone but you never thought of me did you. Do you know how peaceful you look when you sleep. You sleep like an angel. Its a shame though, Emma ended up knowing about someone visiting your house often in the night. She tried to stop me one day from meeting you but she ended up falling and becoming unconsious in the process. I’m lucky she didn’t see my face. It would have been a shame if she did. Who know what I would have to do to keep it a secret. You also saw Blake’s texts and shirt in her cupboard, right. I told you didn’t I he is not right for you. But now that Emma is gone we two can be together and Blake won’t bother us”. Adam’s words were baffling beyond my dreams and had scared me to corner of my mind. His obsession was something I have read and see only in the movies. I realized he has been stalking me for a long time. Make moves so it looked natural. Planning things to make me think of something else is wrong. With whatever courage I had I confronted Adam. “If you ever come close to me or text me I am going to report you to the cops with this call recording. YOU HEAR ME, DO NOT CONTACT ME EVER AGAIN!”, I said from the top of my voice. “But you are on Blake’s phone Grace, that is a silly phone. That doesn’t have recording feature.”, he said. “ I know but mine had”, I said and pulled out my phone from my sleeves. I had the recording started the moment he started to talk about me being in my blue PJs. I realized he saw me so I had to keep it hidden away so he wouldn’t have to know I had something up my sleeve. I placed Blake’s phone in speaker as I needed his voice to captured as well. “YOU HEAR ME, IF I EVER SEE YOU OR HEAR FROM YOU I WILL REPORT YOU! DO NOT CONTACT ME EVER AGAIN!”, I cut the call and pulled off the cable from the socket for my computer. I also switched off the phones after this. Now, there was finally peace and I dropped dead on the floor with my dead legs. I do hope its done for good now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few days later, I headed back to the city. Still fearing he would be there, I was trying to be caution as I reached my place. Emma was back and told she got attacked by someone but she couldn’t see who it was. Adam had left the city and there were no traces of him at the place he stayed. The company he talked about working for never hired him as well. As for Blake, it did not work out in the long run. He may have been nice but he truely wasn’t meant for me. May be Adam was right on that one. It has been 8 years since then. I still wonder what was Adam’s true intensions. He had stalked me out a lot however, he had not hurt me physically or abused me. However, his presence had left a lasting impression on my mind on men and their intensions. I slowly look back into my room and I got a message on my phone. A sense of fear suddenly ran through my spine. Wait, why am I feeling this one again. Is it the paranoia from thinking about my past. I walked slowly to my nightstand that was besides my bed. I picked up the phone which was facing down and slowly turned it upright. I had a look at the screen and finally had a sign of relief. It was my mom texting me Good Night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIN.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Final Symphony</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Its been only few days since I moved to the big city yet, I am already take aback by the shear number of people and things that it brings. Being from a small town you would wonder how a small teen such as myself would survive on his own at this place. However, this is something I must do. I am done with the country life and the monotone life it brings. I had to leave all of it and make something of my own. Obviously my parents were against it but, I did not care for their opinion. I was meant to reach excellence someday and for that I must leave things behind that would drag me back. For now, I have small apartment in an alley that could pretty well be good enough for Jack the Ripper to make it his playground. Working part time while I pursued my goal in the acting field makes it quite challenging for me. I would have to travel a lot and luckily I live in the era where we have metro trains to travel long distances and walkmans to keep us company. I always dream of having a luxurious lifestyle with expensive cars and exquisite art work around me to remind myself and others that I am a man of great taste. But this has to wait, till I get my first break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyday I would wake up, get ready and then head to the metro. I had exactly 5 mix tapes to keep me company during my stay here in the city. The metro was around 2km from where I stayed so I would always have a quick breakfast on-route and then, reach the place by 8:45am. My first metro was at 9am so I had few minutes to spare before my rough day started. Today was different though. My walkman had run out of battery half way through and I was introduced to the chaotic voices of the city. As I reached the tunnel to the metro station platform I could hear a faint sound of violin. As I went closer and closer to the platform the sound grew louder and louder. At the platform I finally met the source of the music. An elderly guy may be in his 60s stood next to a wall as he played his violin. The music had it own sense of softness and sadness to it. Some travelers stood and watched while the others just walked by. Few gave money to the old man while few didn’t. His clothes weren’t that shabby to make his poor but why would someone play music at the station during its busy hours, I wondered. My train had arrived and I dropped few pennies and left for work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next day I reached the station and found him again but I was a bit late so all I could was run and board my train. I looked at him while the train left the station. I wondered if he did this everyday. I decided to look for him during my return that is if, he were still around. Part-time job and acting classes were never easy yet I do manage what I can. The sun had set and it was my time to head back. I reached the station however, he was no where to be found. “I guess he works only during the day”, I said to myself. I headed home and decided to sleep off the night and await for my busy life the next day had in store. On route to my apartment I had gotten a call on my phone. I flipped open my phone but, I didn’t answer it though. It was my dad. He had a habit of calling me on odd days to check in on me. “He never approved of my wishes so why try and reach me”, I said to myself and closed my phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weekend was nearing by and I usually used to go the near by theater where people auditioned for roles. However, the old man’s behavior intrigued me for some reason. I decided that today I will go and play detective, see what he does and probably follow him around. I headed to the station by 6am. It was a very cold day. If it weren’t for my jacket I would be freezing my bottom off. I reached the station and as suspected he wasn’t there. I waited outside the metro station however, I wondered if he would come today. I decided to light off a cigarette while I waited in this cold weather. It was 7am and the weather was warming up but not enough to walk around without a jacket. I had decided to wait off somewhere else when I spotted someone walking towards the entrance. I moved next to a wall near by and watched while I covered my face with my muffler and my hat. An old man, carrying a case, shivering while walking towards the entrance with his wooden cane. To top it off the jacket he wore was thin. I don’t think that is enough for such weather why would he wear this and head over here in this cold time, I wondered. I could see his old body shook during every single step. I followed him slowly as he walked upfront. He walked up to the wall where he always stood. He kept his case down and slowly opened it up. With his shivering hands he picked up his violin and placed it against his chin. With his hands still shaking he brought the bow up close to the violin and after one strong exhale he started to play. Wait, it was only 7:30am. I had seen play at around 8:30am even at close to 9:00am too. Surely, he was not playing it all this while, I thought to myself. I waited at one of the benches and just listened to his music from the side. He played and played and played. He would occasionally take a break to drink water that was available from the nearby water fountain however, that’s it. He would shiver for most part of his walk and even while placing his violin yet he was in complete control when he played it. People passed by and while few dropped their money some didn’t. This continued till 10am and he finally stopped. The station was filled such wonderful music for so long yet many failed to enjoy it. He loaded the money into his pockets and started to place his violin and bow back into the case. He picke dup his violin and then slowly started to walk out of the station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed him to see what next was in store for such a talented old man. He went to a near by bakery and bought some bread and tea. He had his share on his way to the pond near by that was close to the public park. There he sat at a bench while feeding the ducks, pigeons and even squirrels with the bread that he had bought. It was odd that one would spend all of the money they had earned in one go. He relaxed himself to the sight of the nature around him, the raft of ducks that swam around the pond, the flock of pigeons that flew in and out when someone walked by the place where the bread crumbs were thrown, the scurry of squirrels running around the park and onto the trees. He had a smile on his face while he watched all of these yet all I saw was sadness in his eyes. Once his bag of bread was emptied he crushed the bag and dropped it off at the waste-bin while he walked away. I followed him till he eventually went to an old age home. I had way too many questions for which I had no answers for. I went back to the baker shop to see if I could get some details that would ease my mind. I checked with the baker and I learned that this was his daily trend. It has been few months since this activity had started. The baker did not know much however, he did say that the old gentleman would play his violin every day at the station not for money for something else however, he was not told for why though. I needed answers and hence, I had decided that I would confront him tomorrow if he shows up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its a Sunday and here I am waking early again. “I should be in bed”, I told myself. I got ready and headed out for the station.  Just like yesterday, he was at the station by 7am and started playing his violin. Being a Sunday the number of people were less however, he still played on till he wrapped it up at 10 o’clock. I could see that the money he got today was fairly little and yet he still went to the bakery and bought bread and tea with all he got. I followed him till the park and then, walked up to him after he had sat at his bench. “Hi, sorry to have followed you but I wanted to talk to you about few things. Benjamin is my name.”, I said. “He was probably confused since I said I followed him but, he greeted me with a smile and made me sit besides him. He also offered a slice of bread even though there wasn’t any to eat it with. I was happy with his offer and took a slice of bread but, I started to feed the animals along with him. “I see you come to the station everyday to play your violin and that too for long hours yet, you use up all the money you earned in feeding the birds and animals. Why? What if you are sick and you cannot come over for a day or two? How would you feed yourself?”, unconsciously all my questions even the more weird ones were spilled out. He started to talk and we conversed for hours. After a while, I walked with him back to the old age home and we talked for a while there too. After few minutes I bid farewell and headed back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the night as I lay in my bed I felt a weight on my chest. The old man stories had an impact on me. He was once an aspiring musician from a small town who had moved to the city to become big in life. He met the love his live and had a wonderful baby girl child. However, the problem of all aspiring people struck him as well, which is time. He was unable to devote time to his family and this led down a spiral stairs till it reached the fork on the road. Unfortunately, he wasn’t available when his wife made a decision to leave him and head back to her hometown with their kid. He tried to become big by taking shortcuts however, it was down an alley that lead him to prison for mistakes that he had not done. Being out off prison after 30 years he is now at a stage where both fame and happiness are outside his grasp. He knows where she stays and sent letters across to check on them however, the letters never had any responses. There was few stations that this metro connected which they could board on to reach where he is. He had mentioned in the letter that he would be at one of the station waiting for them and to know it his him he would play his violin.  It is odd that things could change from something to nothing and you could do so little to control it. While thinking of all of these, I got a call from my dad yet, my thoughts were so deep that ring-tone fell on my deaf ears. I closed my eyes to head to sleep with my mind set on what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;good-ending&quot;&gt;Good Ending&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a new week at hand I woke up and headed for work. The walkman that kept me company for all these days remained in my pocket. I went by the metro station where the old man played his violin. I waited at the platform for my train while I heard his words play out on musical cords all over the station. My train arrived and I boarded for work without looking back. I started to spend long hours and worked more than I would normally would. I would return back at around 10pm in the night and then, just go straight to bed out of exhaustion. The next day would start and I would go through this cycle again and again. I did this for 2 weeks. I could tell I was moving as fast as I could. I had a purpose which was not for my own for a change and I wanted to see if I could fulfill it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a Sunday and I think I had what I needed. I wore my clothes and headed to the station by 7am. It was still a cold day however, it was warmer than usual. I waited by the station for the old man to come by. He was more or less on the dot and I went straight to him before he took out his violin to do his daily task. “Sir, do you remember me?”, I asked. He nodded his head with a smile. “I have something for you”, I said while I opened his palm and placed two tickets. “I remember you had told me where your wife and daughter might be staying at. Well these are the tickets for your to go and meet them”. You could see a bit of hesitance in his eyes as he looked at the tickets. “I know money was never a problem for your yet you never went to visit them. That is fine. I will be joining you. You don’t have to do this alone if you are worried on how it would turn out to be.” He tried to smile yet one could tell the roller coaster of emotions which was going through him. I grabbed his violin as we both waited for our train to arrive. He remained silent through out our journey. I knew what I did could turn out to be really horrible however, a closure would be a better answer than an indefinite wait. We reached our station and took a cab to reach the house. At last, we are here. The moment of truth. His footsteps were heavier than before as we walked up the porch and up to the front door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He took a long breathe and then, paused before he could knock at the door. He tried to turn back but I held his arm. Before he could utter a work the front door opened. “How can I help you mister? Are you here to meet mommy?”, said a small girl barely 5 or 6 years old. Neither of us knew who this kid was. We heard footsteps reach the main door. “Samantha, how many times do I tell u….”, a voice flew by as the door opened further. There stood a lady may be in her thirties look at both of us while holding the child by her arms. There was a sudden silence around the place as the lady and the old man looked at each other. “Who is this mommy? Do you known him?”, said the little girl. Tears flew down her eyes as she said, “Yes, this your grandpa sweety. Go say hi to him.” There were tear rolling down all our eyes now. The old man crouched as he hugged the little girl and then, he hugged his daughter. “We didn’t reply to your letter cause we were mad at you. But it doesn’t mean you could never come home”. “I’m so sorry”, he said as he hugged her tight. We entered the house as the door behind us closed. Now I knew that his music would never fall on stranger’s ears rather, only the ones he would want it to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bad-ending&quot;&gt;Bad Ending&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a new week at hand I woke up and headed for work. The walkman that kept me company for all these days remained in my pocket. I went by the metro station where the old man played his violin. However, he was not there today. It was odd of him to not be there but I waited at the station for my train. My train arrived yet he was still not there. It was a very cold day and I had to wear multiple layers to keep me warm. May be he didn’t want to or couldn’t do it in such a bad weather, I told myself. The train left the platform and I was off to work. I did long hours of work and headed for home late at night. I dragged my body till I hit my bed. The exhaustion of working long hours had its toll on me and I fell asleep in the same clothes I wore. I woke up the next and got ready. I went to the station a bit early today and he still wasn’t there. “Two days in a row, something is not right”. I quickly rush towards the old home to see him. I reached there and I found him on his bed. He had slipped and fell yesterday while leaving for the station. To make it worse he fell off the stairs outside the home and hit his head pretty bad. I tried to speak to him but all he did was smile and node his head a little. A doctor did come by yesterday however, he said much could not done. “If he doesn’t get back on his feet in 3 days then, there is not much we can do”, apparently were the words of the doctor when he left yesterday. I sat next to him the entire day to see if he would recover however, he didn’t. Every single breathe of his were heavy and quite painful, painful to watch as well. I left for home in the evening while I worried for him. This ‘concern’ was new to me and I did not know from where this came from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next day I went to the station and booked a ticket for myself. I decided to go the address to which the letters were sent to. Upon reaching there I was greeted with only more disappointment. The house was empty and put for sale. I checked with neighbors to see if they had any information however, no one has been there at this house for years apparently nor did they know where they went. I asked a couple of neighbors for any contact address or number however, non had any. I went to a public phone and started flip thought the yellow pages to look for any name that matched the wife’s middle or last name. There was 1 name that kind of matched however, I was not sure. I took out my phone and made a call to it. It rang and rang however, no one picked it up. I told the neighbors about the old man and if anyone did come by to ask them to come to the old home to see him. I had to leave the place as I could do nothing else at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I skipped work again and went over to the old home to see him. He was definitely not improving. I wanted to take him to the park nearby but he was too weak to move. All I could do is sit next to him and watch him fade away slowly. I flipped open my phone and made calls to the number few times however, it was never picked up. I stepped away from the room so I could vent my frustration out on something. I made one last call and then, went back in. I tried to talk my story with him to give him the very little comfort that I could offer and all he did was smile. I didn’t know if my words did reach him but I hope it did. I continued with my story and I heard fast paced footsteps nearing by. “Dad, are you here?”, a voice was heard from near the door. A women, probably in her mid thirties walked in and sat next to him holding his hand. “I’m sorry, I didn’t know.” , she said. The old man had tears rolling by eyes as he looked at the women, “I’m so sorry for the things I put you through” he said with all the energy he had. They sat there in silence for few minutes looking at each other till he slowly he faded away with a smile on his face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Benjamin do you think this was right? Tricking him like this?”. “Honestly Lorien, I don’t think being right or wrong matters anymore”. “I don’t know if he could tell if you where his daughter or not. Even if he did, I don’t think there is a point to it.” He has been though a lot and I don’t want it to end it such a way. My conscious is fine with what I did and that is all that I care for. People make mistakes but does it mean it should haunt us for the rest of our life. I heard my phone ring and I flipped it open, it was my Dad calling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIN.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hosting On Github</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, since I managed to get this up and running. I decided I will go ahead and just jot down the things I did to get this working. This is not a copy paste kind of article however, pointers on how you could take it about to make it work. I will highly recommend that you do your research when hosting your site. There are tons of way to do the same thing. Some site are jaw dropping when you mix JS, CSS, HTML5 hence, take your time to make the site to suit you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pre-requisites&quot;&gt;Pre-requisites:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GitHub Account
It is free for hosting public repository so nothing much to lose.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understanding the basic concepts and commands of GitHub
I started off by going through the following Youtube playlist. Simple and cool to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3usJuxZZUBdjAcilgfQHkRzW&quot;&gt;Git/Github Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Basic idea on writing HTML websites or working with static site generator such as ‘Jekyll’ 
I went with Jekyll since it looks to be easier than writing my own HTML code. The following Youtube playlist was awesome to understand a lot of things in a very short time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB&quot;&gt;Jekyll - Static Site Generator | Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;steps&quot;&gt;Steps:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a repository in the format&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;github_username&amp;gt;.github.io&lt;/code&gt; :&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;eg) My GitHub username is ‘akhilbaburaj’ hence, my repository is ‘akhilbaburaj.github.io’
This would be the repository where all you website(s) are hosted. Yes, you can host multiple sites however, the path will be unique if you want to view different sites. Currently, I have no plans to host multiple sites hence, I am hosting the entire site on root repository path(/).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create your HTML pages or copy paste your HTML files(eg. index.html) to your repository folder on you local machine. Since I went with Jekyll, I used it to create a folder named as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;github_username&amp;gt;.github.io&lt;/code&gt; eg. ‘akhilbaburaj.github.io’. Jekyll creates a default template of files so it is quite easy to host the template and contents for future articles as well. With help from Jekyll you can test it locally as well before making the commit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use GitHub CLI or GitHub Desktop to update your repository:
This should allow you to pull, add, change, commit and then push the files to your repository.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the files are pushed, give it some time before trying to load the page on your browser using the URL &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://&amp;lt;github_username&amp;gt;.github.io/&lt;/code&gt; eg.&lt;a href=&quot;http://akhilbaburaj.github.io/&quot;&gt;http://akhilbaburaj.github.io/&lt;/a&gt;. If things are hosted fine then, your still will officially online for public use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; You can see that the theme I used does not match the default theme provided by Jekyll. There are tons of Themes available for free and you can use them too however,to test you would have to ‘jekyll build’ and ‘jekyll serve’ in the folder when you have your theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to use custom domain like ‘example.io’ then, please make to update your DNS records and also the CNAME file. This setting can be configured from your repository’s setting section (not. your account/profile section). For more steps please follow the steps mentioned in GitHub’s official document:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/adding-or-removing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/&quot;&gt;Adding or removing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps you in directing your path on hosting on GitHub. There are tons of other articles online however, I will recommend that you do go for the most latest article as GitHub has changes quite a bit and some of the earlier steps mentioned are not explicitly required anymore to achieve the same task.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pictures</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As I sit on this couch I see the picture on the wall it is when I realized, time moves so slow when you wait for someone. Someone may not be right word since I know who it is that I am waiting for. Pretty sure it has been few years since I last saw him.. sat with him.. walked with him. I knew him since he was just a kid. He was such a small boy, so active, so full of life. He is nice, kind and genuinely a wonderful person all around. We have a picture of our first meet to remind me of him everyday of my life. It was at the park across the street during an early monsoon. The wind blew hard and I was going to meet my new family. It was going to be a new start for me with them. I was nervous yet with a hope that things would eventually work out. As I walked towards them, I saw him, a small boy with a missing tooth. I was cautious as I took my steps towards them. They were a wonderful family yet a part of held me back. We spent few hours in the park so I could know them better and be comfortable, that’s when he said, ‘Hey Max! Want to play?”. I guess I did not need an introduction by judging the way he just gave me a nickname. “Was Maxine too long to being with?”, I though. To not look rude I decided to follow him for a while and few minutes later, I had naturally started to enjoy his company. Ever since then, I always wanted to be by side as much as possible. We grew up together and we had our beds in the same room so even the nights were also fun. We would secretly stay up late and watch TV together till one day we got caught by mom. Boy was she mad at us but it was fun while it lasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was never physically strong but he sure was strong doing everything that was right. He never had a commanding height nor size, yet he was always caught in fights. I have see him come home with bruises after his school fights. I am pretty sure they hurt a lot but he would scrub it off saying it doesn’t. I am sure he was just standing up for his friends who were the ones getting bullied and being the kind of person he is I bet he would get involved only to get beaten up. I wanted to go with him to his school to show those bullies a piece of my mind but he wouldn’t let me go with him. I guess he was trying to be protective of me even then. It sure wouldn’t be the first time for him. I didn’t go to the same school as him but I did hope I did. His high school years were the not best part of his life. Bad company lured him and he became distant with us. It was tough to spend time with him as he spent less time with his family and me. It would try to chase away his friends when they would come to see him however, this only grew my distance with him to a point everything stopped between us. But luckily there was someone else who stepped into his life during the same time. Elin managed to bring him back but, I didn’t know should I be happy or sad. Should I be happy that he is back to being the nice person he was or sad cause he has someone new one his life who may well be the better half of his life. One day finally got to meet her when he brought her over to our home. She was really sweet and they both made a great pair. All I could do is join them from time to time and hope for the best. The trip to the beach was one of my most fondest memory. We took our picture as the sun sat in for the night. It truly was a wonderful day. However, lives do have their ups and down. During college Elin had to leave town and they ultimately they had to break up. He was sad and filled with sorrow. I did what I could but I knew he needed time and certainly someone else other than me. I wanted to let him know that he would meet someone just like Elin, someone who would be there with him but he never could understand what I told him nor was he ready to understand. All I could do was hope that he would be fine again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the end of his final semester he was finally ready to take on the world as a grown adult. He looked for jobs near-by but nothing clicked. He finally did get one but it was out of town. It was great but, this meant that he would have move out. The separation was expected but I didn’t know it could hurt this much. He said he would come frequently to visit us but I know that would change and it did. He was getting caught up with work and he had cut-down the time to visit us. I wanted to call him but then, I hesitated. Mom used to call him once in a while but it would land in a voice-mail. We didn’t know if he was busy or if he was being distant. I would wait for him to do video chat just to see him and when he did he never looked happy. I wanted to go over to his place but I didn’t want to be a burden. In a year’s time he told us over the call that he had quit his job to join the forces. Mom and dad were furious and they demanded that he returned. I too wanted him to back home. The home were he was truly his own. However, in the end he did leave for his camp and then his first deployment. The last picture he sent was with his uniform. I was so proud of him. He truly looked like a soldier who fights for the people. When ever I missed him I would go to our bedroom and sleep on his bed. His bed gave me some of the best memories of my life. All I could hope for him to return soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The calls were minimal and when ever he did he was on the speaker phone. He voice had life. May be this is what he was meant to do in life. He always stood for what is right and he gets to do that even now. However, it doesn’t stop the lingering thought that he may eventually be broken down by what happens on the front line, that he may change, that things might turn him for the worse or even worse that he may never return. I have lost track of time since we last spoke. I don’t know what year it is nor do I know how most of my days has goes by. Everyday I would wait at the corridor for the front door to open and hope he would be on its other side but it remains a dream. May be I have aged too fast that makes me feel as if a millennia has passed by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up today and I found that my parents has stepped out. May be they went to get the groceries. As I walked passed the hall I saw a box on the coffee table. It had his pictures in them. So many of them, so many memories flooded by as I saw them. I walked back to our bedroom and I laid down on his bed again. “I wish I could see him again”, I thought while I tried to sniff his diminishing scent off his bed. As I closed my eyes I could hear the car pull over upfront. I could hear my parents talk while they walked up the stair. Old habits don’t die that fast as I walked out of our bedroom and stood along the corridor which lead to our main door. The door opened and I saw parents enter the house, sadly no one else was there. I slowly turned my head to go back to my room. ‘Hey Max’, I heard. May be I am dreaming. I turned my head back to the corridor. I still saw only my parents but something urged me to walk towards the front door. I was being cautious again but not because I was scared rather I didn’t want to let my hallucination get the better of me. I reached the door and there he stood at our front lawn. A full grown man who is back home with the same smile I saw the first time. I was ecstatic and you could hear me bark across the street while I shook my tail in any direction it could. I ran to him to welcome home so we could be together as we used to be for the remaining life I still have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIN.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reflection</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;They say in life you grown, learn and experience a lot. I did too. Being from a small town my world was small and sweet. I knew everyone around and so did others. There was little to hide. Growing up I loved standing in front of the almara which we had. It had a huge mirror and I loved looking at myself. Anytime I needed to cheer myself up, or talk to myself, I would stand in front of it because it never lied. As time went by, I made a ton of friends. I played and enjoyed my childhood like any other kid. But we had to move to a new town eventually. My heart did sink in a bit, to be away from my friends. However, they are the type to stay in touch no matter what. We promised each other that we will always call each other and gossip our life for hours over the phone. We got help from our neighbors and friends as me and my parents packaged our luggage during our last day in town. The taxi came to pick us to the station and before boarded for it, everyone gave a big hug. I was moved as this is the first time I am leaving this town and that too for good. We boarded our train and we were to start off our new life in a new town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things were a bit off the moment we reached the final station. It was a crowded city and ever since we got down our train I felt the entire city started right at me. It was a bit uneasy at first, but I did not bother. We took a cab to our new place which already had our furniture dropped off. My parents and I took a while to settle things at their respective places. Nearly the entire day passed by and we were hungry. We decided to eat out and celebrate our new beginning. We freshened up and went to a near-by restaurant. The scene was the same, people stared at us. I know the people in the city are quite flashy with their dressing style but I knew I was not under dressed or out of style. I could hear people murmur and avoid eye contact when I looked at them. My parents told me not to be too concerned with what is happening and just asked me to enjoy the food and our time together. We reached home after a while and I stood in front of the mirror. “I don’t have anything on my dress nor does the dress look that bad.” I said to myself as I looked at my reflection as I questioned myself. In any case, I had to go see a school tomorrow which could be possibly where I would enroll myself. It had a good reputation and I wanted to go there. I changed into my PJ and went to bed so I can be ready for the big day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the alarm on my mobile going off, I finally woke up for the big day. It used to be sound of roosters which did it for me in my hometown but I guess in the city you adapt to alternate sources. With the appointment at 10am we all got ready by 8am. Before we left for the venue which could be possibly my new school, I stood in front my mirror. “You will do awesome here too!”, I said to myself as we headed outside. We reached the school in an hour’s time and the school was exactly how I imagined. I was excited to just be here. We went to meet the principal after waiting for a while. The principal looked stern and so was his tone of voice. He seemed to be reluctant to admit me into the school. I didn’t understand what his problem was but he insisted that I would not be able to handle this. I became furious when he uttered those words. “Is it because I’m a girl? Is it because I’m from a small town? Would it tarnish the school’s reputation if someone as small as I were to join such a large institute?” I wanted to voice my frustrations out however, my dad made sure my voices were heard in the right manner. He stopped me from verbally bombarding the principal and let principal say his side of the story. Once his side was done, my dad took him through his world, on how I am, on how things change one people know me, how I achieve the thing on my own. My dad has a way to pursue people in the right manner and he would make sure people see what he sees through his eyes. It did take a while, however my dad did convince the principal. I wondered if things would have worked out if I vented out my mind like I would do. I guess everything needs a special touch to work out. I was thrilled after our meet as I would be going to an awesome school in the city and I wonder what else in-store was for me in this city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my school clothes still yet to be made ready, I was allowed to join the school next day in my casual clothing. I was nervous, in schools we wear the same attire so we don’t stand out and here I am, the new kid on the block flashing out my presence bluntly to the entire school. I made sure I wore a simple dress for the big day and stood in front of the mirror for quite some time to get myself to focus. “It is fine. You look fine. You will make friends on at a time. People will like you for who you are. “, and may more. I winked at myself to finish my therapy session and headed with my dad to school. I decided to walk up to my class however, my dad insisted to accompany me. As I walked passed various classes people were looking right at me. Boy did I grab attention, I was flushed to silence. I knew that with my dad around people would notice us. I was just pacing to reach my class as quickly as possible. My dad decided to turn back half way through, I guess he realized that I was quite nervous with him around. I reached my class and stood in-front for the introduction while the entire class had their eyes set on me. My heart paced a lot to a point where I blabbered my name out. I did not needed anyone else to make me feel more embarrassed about myself as I was doing quite a good job myself. “Savitha is new to school so Tanu, please do take her around the campus to make her more comfortable with the place”, the teacher said. “Great now they are forcing someone to babysit me. I wanted to use that to break the ice and make friends. I am sure Tina would be reluctant to do so but she cannot overrule the teacher now. I guess I should say sorry to her up-front”, I thought. I sat next to her and to my surprise she was quite nice and friendly. She did not seem to mind the responsibility and we hit it off immediately. With the period coming to an end I could see more people approaching my desk. I guess people are the same everywhere. We start off with a clean slate so there is nothing to judge about unless you had your own story for them. I made quite a few friends but they were all girls though. The guys would prank around with other girls but it looked like they are caution with me. It may be because I am new and they don’t how I would react to. “That is fine”, I thought to myself. This is better than people murmuring on their own and giving me weird looks. The day ended with a couple of us girls and few guys walked throughout the school with me while we chitter-chattered girly stuff. The guys tried playing their ‘I’m too cool’ card when we walked to only be teased out by the girls. It was fun experience overall. I enjoyed this place and it was exactly as I imagined. Our walk ended at the school gate where my dad waited for me to take me home. During dinner I told my parents everything and they were happy that this place was comfortable for me. They asked me if I would like to invite my classmates over the weekend and I was thrilled to have my parents meet them. I called my town friends from the over the phone and we talked about my entire day’s story till late at night. It was very satisfying to have friends who know click with. Before I hit the bed I went to the mirror just to see my face and I loved the smile that ran across it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weekend had arrived and I had a quite a huge gang reach my place. I took them through the tour of our house and then to my bedroom where were gossiped a lot. I had a bad habit of looking at the mirror from time to time to see myself smile and my friend’s noticed this. “Hey, what’s with you and the mirror?”, they asked. I went ahead and told them my silly habit for which they laughed out of humor. Then one of the guys asked me something that was never directed to me in a long time. “Hey, how did you lose your arms?” “Stupid, how blunt can you be!!”, yelled Tanu. “You don’t have to answer that if you don’t want to”, she added. I realized that people refrain from asking this for many reasons and since I was in my hometown for a long time, most people knew the story and didn’t bother much about it. It makes sense why he was curious, he was new after all. “Just some events lead to it, that’s all”, I replied with a smile. “Cause, I am not sure how you get things done on your own.”, he said. I am sure the rest were tensed with the way he spurred out his mind and how I might take it. “Well, I am not handicapped, I am just differently-abled.”, I added. “Cool! So pretty much you are a bad ass. Nice to know!”, he replied as he smirked. I was happy that to him it was just something ‘need to know’ question to him rather than fixate an idea or an image about me. I guess even they were happy with how the entire showdown went through. There was little to none sobbing or sympathetic response from my condition because they did not see any problem with me. It takes a lot for people to interact and when you look different, people tend to act differently. At least all my friends are the same. They see me just like I see myself in the mirror. People stand in front of the mirror and take many pictures. It is not because their reflection looks better on glass but rather because that is how they truly are. You are everything that you see and even more than that. Do what you do because it takes time for people to see the true you like the reflection in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIN.&lt;/p&gt;
