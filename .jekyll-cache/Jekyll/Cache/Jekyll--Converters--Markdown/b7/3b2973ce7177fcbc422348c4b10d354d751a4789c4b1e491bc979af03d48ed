I"ß<p>I donâ€™t know how many days it has been. All I can do is sit in this place without a space to move an inch. It is so uncomfortable and I barely have a place to budge. How did I get here? Why am I here? I donâ€™t have answers for this. Yet, why do I fell it is ok.</p>

<p>Days passed by, I still donâ€™t know if I have ever seen the day light. I donâ€™t know.  all I remember is this emptiness. Where am I? I wondered. Yet, why I do fell the warm of the sun around me as it were to fall on my skin.</p>

<p>Days passed by, it is still so stuffy in here. It is hard to breathe. I think I might choke in here. Yet, I donâ€™t suffocate. It is odd, but I donâ€™t know why I still can breathe and be alive.</p>

<p>Days passed by, I still cannot open my eyes. I donâ€™t know what happened to them, all I sense is the pitch darkness around me. I wondered what things lurked around me. Yet, I felt safe within this darkness. There is serenity with this darkness.</p>

<p>Days passed by, I still hear sounds, they are faint and muffled. I donâ€™t know what they are saying, yet I hear them laugh. It is nice to hear voices; however, â€œwhy do they enjoy my pain and suffering?â€ I wondered.</p>

<p>Days passed by, I am still alive. I still get food, yet I donâ€™t have the freedom to choose what I want eat or when I want eat. I donâ€™t remember if I had freedom before. Yet, I am happy that they still keep me alive.</p>

<p>Days passed by, I still save my energy each day to break free, but it always falls short. I wonder how much more should I suffer. Yet, why do I feel safe being here. â€œWould I anger them with my actions?â€ I thought.</p>

<p>Days passed by, I hear a lot of noise, it not pleasant and it does not ease my mind. They seem to be turning hostile yet, I am still safe. I hope this is just a phase while I plan my escape.</p>

<p>Days passed by, I now feel a lot of pain. I donâ€™t know why. â€œDid I do something wrong?â€ I wondered why. This pain hurts, my chest hurts. It stops for while but it starts again. â€œWhat is going on?â€ I worry with my thoughts.</p>

<p>Days passed by, this pain increases and my body hurts all over. I want to escape but I donâ€™t think I will survive with my strength. I should wait, let this pass byâ€¦. â€œHope these days pass byâ€, is what I prayed.</p>

<p>The day just started, I donâ€™t think I have much time. I donâ€™t want to be disposed off, but I donâ€™t think I have a say in this. I want to scream, but I donâ€™t think I can or remember if I could.</p>

<p>â€œMom! I am not ready to go out! I wonâ€™t survive! Please make them stop!â€ I know my voices do reach her, but I donâ€™t think she can do anything either. She has given up and agreed to this future, a future of mine that is not for anyone else to make, but her.</p>

<p>They want a grown woman to bare them a child, yet they nip the child at their prime. It doesnâ€™t make sense and I canâ€™t voice these thoughts of mine.</p>

<p>â€œMom, I know you tried. You did what you could. You tried to keep me captive to let me out when it was my time, but I guess we both have no voices in the end. Please donâ€™t cry because you are still fine. I donâ€™t mind passing byâ€¦..For you, I would never mindâ€¦.â€</p>

<p>The day passed byâ€¦ one last time.</p>

<p>FIN.</p>
