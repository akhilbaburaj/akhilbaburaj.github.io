I"Ç<p>â€œSo beautifulâ€, that is all that I could think of when I looked at the moon which showered itâ€™s light at me through the window where I sat everyday to gaze the world around me. Ever since I was born the only outside world I knew was through this window and the room where I spent the rest of the day. But it did not matter that my world was so small, because I had him with me. Everyday he would take care of me and join me to gaze upon this small world while he talked his heart out. He always had a look in his eyes when he looked at me, the kind that makes you blush red. Today was a perfect day, I thought as I waited for him to return home to gaze upon the full moon together. However, what unfolded to be nothing more than a reality check.</p>

<p>It was 9:30pm when I heard the footsteps outside the house. However, it did not look like he was alone this time. As the door opened, I saw him walking in with a girl. I couldnâ€™t hear what it was about but both of them had tears in the eyes as if the topic was to hilariously to contain their laughter. â€œWho was sheâ€, â€œ why is she here so late at nightâ€ and other questions ran though my head. I wanted to voice them out, but I was too shy and nervous. All I did was wait near the same window hoping that she would leave and I could continue with night with him.</p>

<p>They kept on speaking for hours and not even for a moment did it occur to him that he kept me waiting. They seemed close..too close. I just wanted to scream at themâ€¦at herâ€¦at him with my face full red with anger, for making me feel the way I felt. At that instance she looked at me. I was paralyzed by the turn of events and could not utter a sound. It looked as if the topic turned as they now both looked at me when they spoke.</p>

<p>He got up and walk towards me while grabbing a poker knife. â€œWait, what is going onâ€, â€œ why a knifeâ€, â€œwhat did she say to u to make you pull the knifeâ€, these questions ran through my mind while I was petrified at that same window.</p>

<p>He grabbed me at my legs and stared to cut with the tiny pocket knife.â€ It hurts!â€ I screamed. A scream that fell on deafâ€™s ears. I fought back as much as I could by driving my nails into his hands causing them to bleed, but it was not effective as he pushed the blade against my legs even more when I resisted. After half way through he stopped using the knife and used his arms to snap my leg into two pieces. I was horrified with the turn of events.</p>

<p>â€œWhy is this happening â€œi thought you loved meâ€, â€œ why did we reach this roadâ€, all these questions flowers though my mind as he carried me over to her. â€œThis is for youâ€, he said as he gave me to her with his bleeding fingers.</p>

<p>â€œWas this my fate?â€ â€œI know we were from two different worlds, but was I only a replacement for her when she was not aroundâ€? â€œWere all those words that you spoke to me meant for herâ€? â€œWas I only a flower for you in the endâ€?</p>

<p>FIN</p>
